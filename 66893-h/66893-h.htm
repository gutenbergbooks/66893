<small>THE POWER OF THE DEAD</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IN that curious little masterpiece <i>A Beleagured
City</i>, Mrs. Oliphant shows
us the dead of a provincial town suddenly
waxing indignant over the conduct
and the morals of those inhabiting the
town which they founded. They rise up
in rebellion, invest the houses, the streets,
the market-places and, by the pressure of
their innumerable multitude, all-powerful
though invisible, repulse the living, thrust
them out of doors and, setting a strict
watch, permit them to return to their roof-trees
only after a treaty of peace and
penitence has purified their hearts, atoned
for their offences and ensured a more
worthy future.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>Undoubtedly a great truth underlies
this fiction, which appears to us far-fetched
because we perceive only material
and ephemeral realities. The dead life
and move in our midst far more really
and effectually than the most venturesome
imagination could depict. It is very
doubtful whether they remain in their
graves. It even seems increasingly certain
that they never allowed themselves
to be confined there. Under the tombstones
where we believe them to lie imprisoned
there are only a few ashes, which
are no longer theirs, which they have
abandoned without regret and which in
all probability they no longer deign to remember.
All that was themselves continues
to have its being in our midst.
How and under what aspect? After all
these thousands, perhaps millions of
years, we do not yet know; and no religion
has been able to tell us with satisfying
certainty, though all have striven to
do so; but we may, by means of certain
tokens, hope to learn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span></p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Without further considering a mighty
but obscure truth, which it is for the
moment impossible to state precisely or
to render palpable, let us concern ourselves
with one which cannot be disputed.
As I have said elsewhere, whatever our
religious faith may be, there is at any rate
one place where our dead cannot perish,
where they continue to exist as really as
when they were in the flesh and often
more actively; and this living abiding-place,
this consecrated spot, which for
those whom we have lost becomes Heaven
or Hell according as we draw nearer to
or travel farther from their thoughts and
their desires, is within ourselves.</p>

<p>And their thoughts and their desires
are always higher than our own. It is,
therefore, by uplifting ourselves that we
approach them. It is we who must take
the first steps, for they can no longer
descend, whereas it is always possible for
us to rise; for the dead, whatever they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
may have been in life, become better
than the best of us. The least worthy of
them, in shedding the body, have shed its
vices, its littlenesses, its weaknesses, which
soon pass from our memory as well; and
the spirit alone remains, which is pure in
every man and able to desire only what is
good. There are no wicked dead, because
there are no wicked souls. This
is why, as we purify ourselves, we restore
life to those who were no more and
transform our memory, which they inhabit,
into Heaven.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>And what was always true of all the
dead is far more true to-day, when only
the best are chosen for the tomb. In the
region which we believe to be under the
earth, which we call the Kingdom of the
Shades and which in reality is the ethereal
region and the Kingdom of Light, there
are at this moment disturbances no less
profound than those which we have experienced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
on the surface of the earth. The
young dead have invaded it from every
side; and since the beginning of this world
they have never been so numerous, so full
of energy and zeal. Whereas in the
customary sequence of the years the
dwelling-place of those who leave us receives
only weary and exhausted lives,
there is not one in this incomparable host
who, to borrow Pericles&#8217; expression, &#8220;has
not departed from life at the height of
glory.&#8221; Not one of them but has gone
up, not down, to his death clad in the
greatest sacrifice that man can make for
an idea that cannot die. All that we have
hitherto believed, all that we have striven
to attain beyond ourselves, all that has
lifted us to the level at which we stand, all
that has overcome the evil days and the
evil instincts of human nature: all this
could have been no more than lies and
illusions if such men as these, such a mass
of merit and of glory, were really annihilated,
had for ever disappeared, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
for ever useless and voiceless, for ever
without influence in a world to which they
have given life.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>It is hardly possible that this could be so
as regards the external survival of the
dead; but it is absolutely certain that it
is not so as regards their survival in ourselves.
Here nothing is lost and no one
perishes. Our memories are to-day peopled
by a multitude of heroes struck down
in the flower of their youth and very
different from the pale and languid cohort
of the past, composed almost wholly of
the sick and the old, who had already
ceased to exist before leaving the earth.
We must tell ourselves that now, in every
one of our homes, both in our cities and in
the country-side, both in the palace and in
the meanest hovel, there lives and reigns
a young dead man in the glory of his
strength. He fills the poorest, darkest
dwelling with a splendour of which it had
never ventured to dream. His constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
presence, imperious and inevitable, diffuses
and maintains a religion and ideas
which it had never known before, hallows
everything around it, makes the eyes look
higher, prevents the spirit from descending,
purifies the air that is breathed and
the speech that is held and the thoughts
that are mustered there and, little by little,
ennobles and uplifts the whole people on
a scale of unexampled vastness.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>Such dead as these have a power as
profound, as fruitful as life and less precarious.
It is terrible that this experience
should have been made, for it is
the most pitiless and the first in such enormous
masses that mankind has undergone;
but, now that the ordeal is over, we shall
soon gather the most unexpected fruits.
It will not be long before we see the differences
widen and the destinies diverge
between the nations which have acquired
all these dead and all this glory and those
which were deprived of them; and we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
perceive with amazement that the nations
which have lost the most are those which
have kept their riches and their men.
There are losses which are inestimable
gains; and there are gains whereby the future
is lost. There are dead whom the
living cannot replace and the mere thought
of whom accomplishes things which our
bodies cannot perform. There are dead
whose energy surpasses death and recovers
life; and we are almost every one of us at
this moment the mandataries of a being
greater, nobler, graver, wiser and more
truly living than ourselves. With all
those who accompany him, he will be our
judge, if it be true that the dead weigh the
soul of the living and that our happiness
depends on their verdict. He will be our
guide and our protector, for it is the first
time, since history has revealed its misfortunes
to us, that man has felt so great
a host of such mighty dead soaring above
his head and speaking within his heart.</p>

<p>We shall live henceforward under their
laws, which will be more just but not more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
severe nor more cheerless than ours; for
it is a mistake to suppose that the dead
love nothing but gloom: they love only
that justice and that truth which are the
eternal forms of happiness.</p>

<p>From the depths of this justice and this
truth in which they are all immersed, they
will help us to destroy the great falsehoods
of existence; for war and death, if they
sow innumerable miseries and misfortunes,
have at least the merit of destroying as
many lives as they occasion evils. And all
the sacrifices which they have made for us
will have been in vain&mdash;and this is not
possible&mdash;if they do not first of all bring
about the fall of the lies on which we live
and which it is not necessary to name, for
each of us knows his own and is ashamed
of them and will be eager to make an end
of them.</p>

<p>They will teach us, before all else, from
the depths of our hearts which are their
living tombs, to love those who outlive
them, since it is in them alone that they
wholly exist.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">SIR OLIVER LODGE is one of the
most distinguished men of learning in
our day. He is also one of the oldest,
most active and most prominent members
of that well-known Society for Psychical
Research which, founded in 1882, has ever
since striven to study with irreproachable
scientific precision all the wonderful, inexplicable,
occult and supernatural phenomena
which have always baffled and still
elude the comprehension of mankind. In
addition to his purely scientific works, of
which, not being qualified to judge, I do
not speak, he is the author of some extremely
remarkable books, such as <i>Man
and the Universe</i>, <i>The Ether of Space</i> and
<i>The Survival of Man</i>, in which the loftiest
and most daring metaphysical speculations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
are constantly controlled by the most prudent,
wise and steadfast common sense.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver Lodge, therefore, is at the
same time a philosopher and a practical,
working scientist, accustomed to scientific
methods which do not readily allow him to
go astray; he has, in a word, one of the
best-balanced brains that we could hope
to meet; and he is convinced that the dead
do not die and that they are able to communicate
with us. He has tried to make
us share his conviction in <i>The Survival of
Man</i>. I am not sure that he has quite
succeeded. True, he gives us a certain
number of extraordinary facts, but they
are facts which, in the last resort, can be
explained by the unconscious intervention
of intelligences other than those of the
dead. He does not bring us the irrefutable
proof, such as we should consider,
for instance, the revelation of an incident,
a detail, a piece of information so absolutely
unknown to any living creature that
it could come only from a spirit no longer
of this world. We must admit, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
that such a proof is, as he says, as difficult
to conceive as to provide.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Sir Oliver&#8217;s youngest son, Raymond,
was born in 1889, became an engineer and
enlisted for the duration of the war in
September, 1914. He was sent out to
Flanders early in the spring of 1915; and,
on the 14th of September of the same
year, before Ypres, while the company
under his command was leaving the front-line
trench, he was hit in the left side by a
splinter of a shell; and he died a few hours
later.</p>

<p>He was, as a photograph shows us, one
of those admirable young British soldiers
who are the perfect type of a robust, fresh,
joyous humanity, clean and bright, and
whose death seems the more cruel and the
more incredible as it annihilates a greater
aggregate of strength, hope and beauty.</p>

<p>His father has dedicated to his memory
a volume entitled, <i>Raymond, or Life
and Death</i>; and we are at first somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
bewildered at seeing that it is not, as one
might expect, a book of lamentation, regrets
and tears, but the accurate, deliberately
impassive and at times almost cheerful
report of a man of learning who
thrusts aside his sorrow so that he may see
clearly before him, wrestles with the
thought of death and beholds the rising
dawn of an immense and very strange
hope.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>I will not linger over the first part of
the volume, which aims at making us acquainted
with Raymond Lodge. It contains
some forty letters written in the
trenches, the testimony of his brother-officers&#8217;
devotion to him, details of his death
and so on. The letters, I may say in
passing, are charmingly vivid and marked
by a delicate and delightful humour whose
only object is to reassure those who are not
themselves in danger. I have not time to
dwell upon them; and they are not what
most interests us here.</p>

<p>But the second part, which Sir Oliver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
Lodge calls <i>Supernormal Portion</i>, passes
from the life that exists on the surface of
our earth and introduces us into a very
different world.</p>

<p>In the very first lines, the author reminds
us that he has &#8220;made no secret of
his conviction, not merely that personality
persists, but that its continued existence is
more entwined with the life of every day
than has been generally imagined; that
there is no real breach of continuity between
the dead and the living; and that
methods of intercommunion across what
has seemed to be a gulf can be set going
in response to the urgent demand of affection;
that in fact, as Diotima told Socrates
(<i>Symposium</i>, 202 and 203), &#8216;Love
bridges the Chasm.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Oliver Lodge, then, is persuaded
that his son, though dead, has not ceased to
exist and that he has not gone far from
those who love him. Raymond, in fact,
seeks to communicate with his father as
early as eleven days after his death. We
know that these communications or so-called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
communications from beyond the
grave&mdash;let us not prejudge the issue for
the moment&mdash;are made through the
agency of a medium who is or believes
himself to be inspired or possessed by the
deceased or by a familiar spirit speaking
in his name and repeating what the latter
reveals to him. The medium conveys his
information either orally or by automatic
writing, or again, although this is very
rare in the present instance, by table-turning.
But I will pass over these preliminaries,
which would carry us too far, and
come straight to the communication which
is, I think, the most astonishing of all and
perhaps the only one that cannot be explained,
or at least is exceedingly difficult
to explain, by the intervention of the living.</p>

<p>About the end of August, 1915, that is
to say, not many days before his death,
Raymond, who, as we have seen, was near
Ypres, had been photographed with the
officers of his battalion by a travelling photographer.
On the 27th of September<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
following, in the course of a sitting with
the medium Peters, the spirit speaking by
Peters&#8217; mouth said, suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have several portraits of this boy.
Before he went away you had a good portrait
of him&mdash;two, no, three. Two where
he is alone and one where he is in a group
of other men. He is particular that I
should tell you of this. In one you see his
walking-stick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now at that time the members of Sir
Oliver Lodge&#8217;s family did not know of the
existence of this group. They attached no
great importance, however, to the revelations
but in subsequent sittings, notably on
the 3rd of December, before the photographs
had arrived, before they were seen,
more detailed information was received.
According to the spirit&#8217;s statements, the
photograph was of a dozen officers or
more, taken out of doors, in front of a
sort of shelter (the medium kept drawing
vertical lines in the air). Some were sitting
down and some were standing up at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the back. Raymond was sitting; somebody
was leaning on him. There were
several photographs taken.</p>

<p>On the 7th of December, the photographs
arrived at Mariemont, Sir Oliver&#8217;s
house near Edgbaston. There were three
copies, all differing slightly, of the same
group of twenty-one officers, those in the
back row standing up, the others seated.
The group was taken outside a sort of temporary
wooden structure, such as might be
a hospital shed, with six conspicuous nearly
vertical lines on the roof. Raymond was
one of those sitting on the ground in front;
his walking-stick, mentioned in the first
revelation, was lying across his feet. And
a striking piece of evidence is that his is
the only instance where one man is leaning
or resting his hand on the shoulder of another,
in two of the photographs, or, in
the third, his leg.</p>

<p>This manifestation is one of the most remarkable
that have hitherto been obtained,
because it eliminates almost entirely any
telepathic interference, that is to say, any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
subconscious intercommunication between
the persons present at the sitting, all of
whom were absolutely unaware of the existence
of the photographs. If we refuse
to admit the intervention of the deceased&mdash;which
should, I agree, be admitted only
in the last resort&mdash;we must, in order to
explain the revelation, suppose that the
subconsciousness of the medium or of one
of those present entered into communication,
through the vast mazes and deserts
of space and amid millions of strange
souls, with the subconsciousness of one of
the officers or of one of the people who
had seen these photographs whose existence
there was no reason for suspecting.
This is possible; but it is so fortuitous, so
prodigious that the survival and intervention
of the deceased would, in the circumstances,
seem almost less supernatural and
more probable.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>I will not enter into the details of the
numerous sittings which preceded or followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
this one; nor will I even undertake
to summarize them. To share the emotion
aroused, we must read the reports
which faithfully reproduce these strange
dialogues between the living and the dead.
We receive the impression that the departed
son comes daily closer and closer
to life and converses more and more easily,
more and more familiarly with all those
who loved him before he was overtaken
by the shadows of the grave. He recalls
to each of them a thousand little forgotten
incidents. He remains among his own
kindred as though he had never left them.
He is always present and prepared to answer.
He mingles so completely in their
whole life that no one any longer thinks
of mourning his loss. They question him
about his present state, ask him where he
is, what he is, what he is doing. He needs
no pressing; he at once declares himself
astonished at the incredible reality of that
new world. He is very happy there, reforming
himself, condensing himself, so to
speak, and gradually finding himself again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
The existence of the intelligence and of
the will, disencumbered of the body, is
freer, lighter, of greater range and diffusion,
but continues very like what it was
in the flesh. The environment is no longer
physical but spiritual; and there is a translation
to another plane rather than the
break, the complete overthrow, the extraordinary
transitions which we are
pleased to imagine. After all, is it not
fairly plausible? And are we not wrong
in believing that death changes everything,
from one day to the next, and that there
is a sudden and inconceivable abyss between
the hour which precedes decease
and that which follows it? Is it in conformity
with the habits of nature? Is the
life-force which we carry within ourselves
and which doubtless cannot be extinguished,
is that force to so great a degree
crippled and cramped by our body that,
when it leaves this body, it becomes, then
and there, entirely different and unrecognizable?</p>

<p>But I must set a limit to speculation and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
lest I exceed the limits of this essay, I
must pass by two or three revelations less
striking than that of the photograph, but
pretty strange notwithstanding. Obviously,
it is not the first time that such manifestations
have occurred; but these are
really of a higher quality than those which
crowd several volumes of the <i>Proceedings</i>.
Do they furnish the proof for
which we ask? I do not think so; but
will any one ever be able to supply us with
that compelling proof? What can the
discarnate spirit do when trying to establish
that it continues to exist? If it
speak to us of the most secret, the most
private incidents of a common past, we
reply that it is we who are reviving those
memories within ourselves. If it aim at
convincing us by its description of the
world beyond the grave, not all the most
glorious and unexpected pictures of that
world which it might trace are worth anything
as evidence, for they cannot be controlled.
If we seek a proof by asking
it to foretell the future, it confesses that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
it does not know the future much better
than we do, which is likely enough, seeing
that any knowledge of this kind implies a
sort of omniscience and consequently omnipotence
which can hardly be acquired in
a moment. All that remains to it, therefore,
is such little snatches of evidence and
uncertain attempts at proof as we find here.
It is not enough, I admit; for psychometry,
that is to say, a similar manifestation
of clairvoyance between one living subconsciousness
and another, gives almost
equally astonishing results. But here as
there these results show at least that we
have around us wandering intelligences, already
enfranchised from the narrow and
burdensome laws of space and matter, that
sometimes know things which we do not
know or no longer know. Do they emanate
from ourselves, are they only manifestations
of faculties as yet unknown, or
are they external, objective and independent
of ourselves? Are they merely alive
in the sense in which we speak of our
bodies, or do they belong to bodies which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
have ceased to exist? That is what we
cannot yet decide; but it must be acknowledged
that, once we admit their existence,
which at this date is hardly contestable, it
becomes much less difficult to agree that
they belong to the dead.</p>

<p>This at least may be said: if experiments
such as these do not demonstrate positively
that the dead are able directly,
manifestly and almost materially to mingle
with our existence and to remain in
touch with us, they prove that they continue
to live in us much more ardently, profoundly,
personally and passionately than
had hitherto been believed; and that in itself
is more than we dared hope.</p>

<small>BAD NEWS</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR more than four years, evil tidings
passed night and day over almost
half the world of men. Never since our
earth came into being were they known to
spread in crowds so dense and busy and
commanding. In the happy days of peace,
we would come upon the gloomy visitants
here and there, travelling over hill and
dale, nearly always alone, sometimes in
couples, rarely in companies of three,
timid and shy, seeking to pass unnoticed
and humbly undertaking the smallest messages
of sorrow that destiny confided to
their charge. Now they go with heads
erect; they are almost arrogant; and
swollen with their importance, they neglect
any misfortunes that are not deathly.
They encumber the roads, cross the seas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
and rivers, invade the streets, do not forget
the by-ways and climb the most rugged
and stony tracks. There is not a hovel
cowering in the dingiest and most obscure
suburb of a great city, not a cottage hidden
in the recesses of the poorest hamlet
of the most inaccessible mountain, which
escapes their search and towards which
one of them, detached from the sinister
band, does not hasten with its little footstep,
eager, pitiless and sure. Each has
its goal whence nothing can divert it.
Through time and space, over rocks and
walls they press onward, swift and determined,
blind and deaf to all that would retard
them, thinking only of fulfilling their
duty, which is to announce as soon as may
be to the most sensitive and defenceless
heart the greatest sorrow that can fall
upon it.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>We watch them pass as emissaries of
destiny. To us they seem as fatal as the
very misfortune of which they are but the
heralds; and no one dreams of barring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
the way before them. So soon as one of
them arrives, all unexpected, in our midst,
we leave everything, we rush forward, we
gather round it. Almost a religious fear
compasses it about; we whisper reverently;
and we should bow no lower in the presence
of a messenger of God. Not only
would no one dare to contradict it, or
advise it, or beg it to be patient, to grant
a few hours of respite, to hide in the darkness
or to arrive by a longer road; on the
contrary, all compete in offering it zealous
if humble service. The most compassionate,
the most pitiful are the most assiduous
and obsequious, as though there were no
duty more unmistakable, no act of charity
more meritorious than to lead the dark
envoy by the shortest and the quickest way
to the heart which it is to strike.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>Once again, we are here confounding
that which belongs to destiny with that
which belongs to ourselves. The misfortune
was perhaps not to be avoided; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
a great part of the sorrows that attend
it remain in our power. It is for us to
be careful of them, to direct them, to subdue
them, disarm them, delay them, turn
them aside and sometimes even to stop
them altogether.</p>

<p>In effect, we hardly yet know the psychology
of sorrow, which is as deep, as
complex and as worthy of study as the
passions to which we devote so much of our
time. In everyday life, it is true, great
sorrows, though not so rare as we could
have wished, were nevertheless too widely
scattered for us to study them easily, step
by step. To-day, alas, they are the
ground of all our thoughts; and we are
learning at last that, even as love or happiness
or vanity, they have their secrets,
their habits, their illusions, their sophistries,
their dark corners, their baffling
mazes and their unforeseen abysses; for
man, whether he love or rejoice or weep,
remains ever constant to himself!</p>

<p>It is not true, as we too willingly agree,
that, since unhappiness must be known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
sooner or later, our only duty is to reveal
it at the earliest moment, for the sorrow
that is yet green is very different from the
sorrow that is already fading. It is not
true, as we admit without question, that
anything is better than ignorance or uncertainty
and that there is a sort of cowardice
in not forthwith announcing the
bad news which we know to those whom
it must prostrate in the dust. On the contrary,
cowardice lies in ridding ourselves
of the bad news as quickly as we may and
in not bearing its whole burden, secretly
and alone, as long as we are able. When
the bad news arrives, our first duty is to
set it apart, to prevent it from spreading,
to master it as we would a malefactor or a
stalking pestilence, to close all means of
escape, to mount guard over it, so that it
cannot break forth and do harm. Our
duty is not merely, as the best of us and
the most prudent seem to believe, to usher
in the bad news with a thousand precautions,
with short and muffled, sidelong and
measured steps, by the back-door, into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
dwelling which it is to devastate; rather
is it our duty definitely to forbid its entrance
and to have the courage to chain it
in our own dwelling, which it will fill with
unjust and insupportable reproaches and
upbraidings. Instead of making ourselves
the easy echo of its cries, we should think
only of stifling its voice. Each hour that
we thus pass in restless and painful intimacy
with the hateful prisoner is an hour
of suffering which we accept for ourselves
and which we spare the victim of fate. It
is almost certain that the malignant recluse
will end by escaping our vigilance;
but here the very minutes have their value
and there is no gain, however small, that
we are entitled to neglect. The hour-glass
that measures the phases of sorrow is
much finer and truer than that which marks
the stages of pleasure. The time that
passes between the death of one whom we
love and the moment when we hear of his
death is as full of pain as it is of days.
Most to be feared of all is the first blow of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
misfortune; it is then that the heart is
smitten and torn with a wound that will
never heal. But this blow has not its
shattering and sometimes mortal force unless
it strike its victim at once and, so to
speak, fresh from the event. Every hour
that is interposed deadens the sting and
lessens its virulence. A death already
some weeks old no longer wears the same
face as that which is made known on the
very day when it occurs; and, if a few
months have covered it, it is no longer a
death, it has become a memory. The days
that divide us from it have almost the
same value whether they pass before we
hear of it or afterwards. They remove
beforehand from the eyes and heart the
blinding horror of the loss; they step forward
and draw it out of the clutch of madness
into a past like that which softens
regret. They weave a sort of retrospective
memory which stretches into the past
and grants straightway all that true memory
would have given little by little, hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
by hour, during the long months that part
the first despair from the sorrow which
grows wise and reconciled and ready to
hope anew.</p>

<small>THE SOUL OF NATIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the admirable and touching pages in
which Octave Mirbeau bequeaths his
last thoughts to us, the great friend whose
loss is mourned by all who in this world
hunger and thirst after justice expresses
his surprise at finding how in the supreme
moments of its life the collective soul of
the French nation differs from the soul of
each of the individuals of which it is composed.</p>

<p>He had devoted the best part of his
work to examining, dissecting, presenting
in a blinding and sometimes unbearable
light and stigmatizing with unequalled eloquence
and bitterness the weaknesses and
selfishness, the folly and meannesses, the
vanity and sordid money-sense, the lack of
conscience, honesty, charity, dignity, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
shameful stains on the life of his fellow-countrymen.
And behold, in the hour of
insistent duty, there arises suddenly, as in
a fairy scene, out of the quagmire which
he had so long stirred with rough and generous
disgust, the purest, noblest, most
patient, fraternal and whole-hearted spirit
of heroism and sacrifice that the world has
ever known, not only in the most glorious
days of its history, but even in the time of
its most romantic legends, which were but
glorious dreams which it never hoped to
realize.</p>

<p>I could say as much of another nation,
which I know well, since it lives in the land
where I was born. The Belgians, in the
guise in which we saw them daily, appeared
to give us no promise of a noble soul.
They seemed to us narrow and limited, a
little commonplace, honest in a mean, inglorious
way, without ideals or generous
aspirations, wholly absorbed by their petty
material welfare, their petty local wrangles.
Yet, when the same hour of duty
sounded for them, more menacing and formidable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
than those of the other nations,
because it preceded all of them in a terrible
mystery; while there was everything to
gain and nothing to lose, save honour, if
they proved faithless to a plighted word;
at the first call of their conscience aroused
as by a thunderbolt, without hesitating or
glancing at what they had to meet or undergo,
with an unanimous and irresistible
impulse, they astonished mankind by a decision
such as no other people had ever
taken and saved the world, well knowing
that themselves could not be saved. And
this assuredly is the noblest sacrifice that
the heroes and martyrs who have hitherto
appeared to be the professed exponents of
sublime courage are able to achieve upon
this earth of ours.</p>

<p>On the other hand, to those of us who
had had occasion to mix with Germans,
who had lived in Germany and believed
that they knew German manners and letters,
it seemed beyond doubt that the Bavarians,
Saxons, Hanoverians and Rhinelanders,
notwithstanding some defects of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
education rather than character which
grated upon us a little, also possessed certain
qualities, notably a genial kindness, a
gravity, a laboriousness, a steadiness, an
uncomplaining temper, a simplicity in their
domestic life, a sense of duty and a habit of
taking life conscientiously, which we had
never known or had succeeded in losing.
So, despite the warnings of history, we
were struck dumb with amazement and at
first refused to believe the early tales of
atrocities which were not incidental, as in
every war, but deliberate, premeditated,
systematic and perpetrated with a light
heart by an entire people setting itself of
sober purpose and with a sort of perverse
pride outside the pale of humanity, transforming
itself of a sudden into a pack of
devils more formidable and destructive
than all those which Hell had hitherto
belched forth into our world.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>We knew already and Dr. Gustave Le
Bon had demonstrated to us in a curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
way that the soul of a crowd does not resemble
the soul of any of its component
members. According to the leaders and
the circumstances that control it, the collective
soul is sometimes loftier, juster,
more generous and most often more impulsive,
more credulous, more cruel, more
barbarous and blind. But a crowd has
only a provisional, momentary soul, which
does not survive the short-lived and nearly
always violent event that calls it into being;
and its contingent and transitory psychology
is hardly able to tell us how the profound,
lasting and, so to speak, immortal
soul of a nation takes shape.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>It is quite natural that a nation should
not know itself at all and that its acts
should plunge it into a state of bewilderment
from which it does not recover until
history has explained them to a greater or
lesser degree. None of the men who
make up a nation knows himself; still less
does any of them know his fellows. Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
one of us really knows who or what he is;
not one of us can say what he will do in
unexpected circumstances which are a trifle
more serious than those which form the
customary tissue of life. We spend our
existence in questioning and exploring ourselves;
our acts are as much a revelation
to ourselves as to others; and, the nearer
we draw to our end, the farther stretches
the vista of that which still remains for us
to discover. We own but the smallest
part of ourselves; the rest, which is almost
the whole, does not belong to us at all, but
merges in the past and the future and in
other mysteries more unknown than the
future or the past.</p>

<p>What is true of each one of us is very
much more true of a great nation composed
of millions of men. That represents
a future and a past stretching incomparably
farther than those of a single human
life. We admit and constantly repeat
that a nation is guided by its dead.
It is certain that the dead continue to live
in it a far more active life than is generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
believed and that they control it unknown
to itself, even as, at the other end of the
ages, the men of the future, that is to say,
all those who are not yet born, all those
whom it carries within itself as it does its
dead, play no less important a part in a nation&#8217;s
decisions. But in its very present,
at the moment when it is living and putting
forth its activity on this earth, in addition
to the power of those who no longer are
and those who are not yet, there is outside
the nation, outside the aggregate of bodies
and brains that make it up, a host of forces
and faculties which have not found or have
not wished to take their place, or which do
not abide in the nation consistently, and
which nevertheless belong to it as essentially
and direct it as effectively as those
which are comprised within it. What our
body contains when we believe ourselves
circumscribed is little in comparison with
what it does not contain; and it is in what
the body does not contain that the highest
and most powerful part of our being seems
to dwell. We must not forget that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
grows stronger each day that we neither
die nor come into being, in a word, that we
are not wholly incarnate, and that, on the
other hand, our flesh comprises much more
than ourselves. It is this that constitutes all
the floating forces which make up the real
soul of a people, forces very much deeper
and more numerous than those which seem
fixed in the body and the spirit. They do
not show themselves in the petty incidents
of daily life, which concern only the mean
and narrow covering in which a nation goes
sheltered; but they unite, join forces and
reveal their passionate ardour at the grave
and tragic hours when everlasting destiny
is at stake. They then lay down decisions
which history inscribes on her records, decisions
whose grandeur, generosity and
heroism astonish even those who have
taken them more or less unknown to themselves
and often in spite of themselves, decisions
which are manifested in their own
eyes as an unexpected, magnificent and incomprehensible
revelation of themselves.</p>

<small>THE MOTHERS</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was they who bore the main burden
of suffering in this war.</p>

<p>In our streets and open spaces and all
along the roads, in our churches, in our
towns and villages, in every house, we
come into contact with mothers who have
lost their son or are living in an anguish
more cruel than the certainty of death.</p>

<p>Let us try to understand their loss.
They know what it means, but they do not
tell the men.</p>

<p>Their son is taken from them at the
fairest moment of his life, when their own
is in its decline. When a child dies in infancy,
it is as though his soul had hardly
gone, as though it were lingering near the
mother who brought it into the world,
awaiting the time when it may return in a
new form. The death which visits the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
cradle is not the same as that which spreads
terror over the earth; but a son who dies
at the age of twenty does not come back
again and leaves not a gleam of hope behind
him. He carries away with him all
the future that his mother had remaining
to her, all that she gave to him and all his
promise: the pangs, anguish and smiles
of birth and childhood, the joys of youth,
the reward and the harvest of maturity, the
comfort and the peace of old age.</p>

<p>He carries away with him something
much more than himself: it is not his life
only that comes to an end, it is numberless
days that finish suddenly, a whole generation
that becomes extinct, a long series of
faces, of little fondling hands, of play and
laughter, all of which fall at one blow on
the battle-field, bidding farewell to the sunshine
and reentering the earth which they
will not have known. All this the eyes of
our mothers perceive without understanding;
and this is why, at certain times, the
weight and sadness of their glance are
more than any of us can bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>And yet they do not weep as the mothers
wept in former wars. All their sons disappear
one by one; and we do not hear
them complain or moan as in days gone by,
when great sufferings, great massacres and
great catastrophes were surrounded by the
clamours and lamentations of the mothers.</p>

<p>They do not gather in the public places,
they do not utter recriminations, they rail
at no one, they do not rebel. They swallow
their sobs and stifle their tears, as
though obeying a command which they
have passed from one to the other, unknown
to the men.</p>

<p>We do not know what it is that sustains
them and gives them the strength to endure
the remnant of their lives. Some of them
have other children; and we can understand
that they transfer to these the love
and the future which death has shattered.
Many of them have never lost or are striving
to recover their faith in the eternal
promises; and here again we can understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
that they do not despair, for the
mothers of the martyrs did not despair
either. But thousands of others, whose
home is for ever deserted and whose sky
is peopled by none but pale phantoms, retain
the same hope as those who keep on
hoping. What gives them this courage
which astonishes whenever we behold it?</p>

<p>When the best, the most compassionate,
the wisest among us meet one of these
mothers who has just stealthily wiped her
eyes, so that the sight of her unhappiness
may not offend others who are happier,
when we seek for words which, uttered
amid the glaring directness of the most
awful sorrow that can strike a human
heart, shall not sound like odious or ridiculous
lies, we can hardly find anything to
say to her. We speak to her of the justice
and the beauty of the cause for which
her hero fell, of the immense and necessary
sacrifice, of the remembrance and gratitude
of mankind, of the irreality of life, which
is measured not by the length of days but
by the lofty height of duty and glory. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
add perhaps that the dead do not die, that
there are no dead, that those who are no
more live nearer to our souls than when
they were in the flesh and that all that we
loved in them lingers in our hearts so
long as it is visited by our memory and
revived by our love.</p>

<p>But, even while we speak, we feel the
emptiness of what we say. We are conscious
that all this is true only for those
whom death has not hurled into the abyss
where words are nothing more than childish
babble; that the most ardent memory
cannot take the place of a dear reality
which we touch with our hands or lips;
and that the most exalted thought is as
nothing compared with the daily going out
and coming in, the familiar presence at
meals, the morning and evening kiss, the
fond embrace at the departure and the
intoxicating delight at the return. The
mothers know and feel this better than we
do; and that is why they do not answer
our attempts at consolation and why they
listen to them in silence, finding within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
themselves other reasons for living and
hoping than those which we, vainly searching
the whole horizon of human certainty
and thought, try to bring them from the
outside. They resume the burden of their
days without telling us whence they derive
their strength or teaching us the secret of
their self-sacrifice, their resignation and
their heroism.</p>

<small>THREE UNKNOWN HEROES</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Belgian government published
last year a <i>Reply to the German
White Book of 10 May 1915</i>.</p>

<p>This reply gives peremptory and categorical
denials to all the allegations in the
White Book on the subject of <i>francs-tireurs</i>,
of attacks by civilians and of the
Belgian women&#8217;s cruelty to the German
prisoners and wounded. It contains a
body of authentic and overwhelming evidence
upon the massacres at Andenne,
Dinant, Louvain and Aerschot which enables
history here and now to pronounce
its verdict with even greater certainty than
the most scrupulous jury of a criminal
court.</p>

<p>Among the most frightful incidents reported
in these accounts by eye-witnesses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
I would linger to-day upon only two of
those which marked the sack of Aerschot;
not that they are more odious or cruel than
the others&mdash;on the contrary, beside the
unprovoked murders and wholesale executions
at Andenne, Dinant and Louvain,
which are of unsurpassable horror, they
seem almost kindly&mdash;but I select them
for the very reason that they display more
clearly than in its most violent excesses
what we may call the normal mentality of
the German army and the abominable
things which it did when it believed itself
to be acting with justice, moderation and
humanity. I select them above all because
they show us the admirable and
touching state of mind, as displayed amidst
a terrible ordeal, of a little Belgian city,
the most innocent of all the victims of this
war, and offer for our contemplation instances
of simple and heroic self-sacrifice
which have escaped notice and which it is
well to bring to light, for they are as beautiful
as the most splendid examples in the
fairest pages of Plutarch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Aerschot is a humble and happy little
town in Flemish Brabant, one of those
modest unknown clusters of habitations
which, like Dinant, for ever to be regretted
and buried in the past, nobody used to visit,
because they contained no buildings of
note, but which retained and represented
all the more, in the depths of their silence
and their placid isolation, Flemish life in
its most special, intimate, intense, traditional,
suave and peaceable aspect. In
these half-rustic little cities we find hardly
any industries, at most a malt-kiln or two,
a corn-mill, an oil-works, a chicory-factory.
Their life is almost agricultural; and the
well-to-do inhabitants live on the produce
or the rents of their fields, their meadows
and their woods. The houses in the
church-square are substantial-looking,
more or less cubical in shape and painted
virgin white; their carriage-gates are
adorned with glittering brasses. All
through the week the square is almost deserted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and wakens into life only on market-days
and on Sunday mornings, at the
hour of high mass. In a word, it is a picture
of tranquillity, of placid waiting for
meals and repose, of drowsy, easy existence
and perhaps of happiness, if happiness
consists in being happy in a half-slumber
free of remote ambitions, exaggerated
passions or over-eager dreams.</p>

<p>It was here, in this peaceful sojourn of
immemorial restfulness, which not even
the war had hitherto disturbed below the
surface, that, on the 19th of August, 1914,
at nine o&#8217;clock in the morning, after the
retreat of the last Belgian soldiers, the
square was suddenly invaded by a dense
and endless stream of German troops.
The burgomaster&#8217;s son, a lad of fifteen,
hurried to close the Venetian shutters of
his father&#8217;s house and was wounded in the
leg by one of the bullets which the victors
fired at random through the windows.</p>

<p>At ten o&#8217;clock, the German officer in
command sent for the burgomaster, M.
Tielemans, to appear at the Town-hall.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
He was received with insults, hustled and
abused for a <i>Schweinhund</i>, or pig-dog, a
species of animal which appears to be indigenous
to Germany.</p>

<p>Next, Colonel Stenger, commanding the
8th infantry brigade, and his two aides-de-camp
took up their quarters in the burgomaster&#8217;s
house in the church-square and, I
may add in passing, forthwith broke open
all the drawers in their rooms, after which
they went to the balcony and watched the
march-past of their troops.</p>

<p>At four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, obsessed
by the delusion of <i>francs-tireurs</i>,
some soldiers, seized with panic, began to
fire shots in the streets. The colonel,
standing on the balcony, was hit by a German
bullet and fell. One of the aides-de-camp
rushed downstairs shouting:</p>

<p>&#8220;The colonel is dead! I want the
burgomaster!&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Tielemans felt that his time was
come:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a serious matter for me,&#8221; he
said to his wife.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>She squeezed his hand and urged him to
keep courage. The burgomaster was arrested
and ill-treated by the soldiers. In
vain his wife remarked to the captain that
her husband and son could not have fired,
since they possessed no weapons.</p>

<p>&#8220;That makes no difference,&#8221; replied the
bully in uniform; &#8220;he&#8217;s responsible.
Also,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I want your son.&#8221;</p>

<p>This son was the boy of fifteen who had
been wounded in the leg. As he had a
difficulty in walking, because of his wound,
he was brutally jostled before his mother&#8217;s
eyes and escorted with kicks to the Town-hall,
there to join his father.</p>

<p>Meanwhile this same captain, persisting
in his contention that his men had been
fired upon, compelled Madame Tielemans
to go through the house with him, from cellar
to attic. He was obliged to observe
that all the rooms were empty and all the
windows closed. Throughout this inspection,
he threatened the poor woman with his
revolver. Her daughter placed herself
between her mother and their sinister visitor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
who did not understand. When they
returned to the hall downstairs, the mother
asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is to become of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Coldly, he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be shot; so will your daughter
and your servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pillage and the methodical setting
on fire of the town now began. All the
houses on the right-hand side of the square
were in flames. From time to time, the
soldiers apostrophized the women, shouting:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to be shot, you&#8217;re going
to be shot!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;At that moment,&#8221; says Madame Tielemans,
in her sworn deposition, &#8220;the soldiers
were leaving our house, their arms
filled with bottles of wine. They opened
the windows and removed all the contents
of our rooms. I turned away so as not to
behold the pillage. By the lurid light of
the burning houses, my eyes fell upon my
husband, my son and my brother-in-law,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
accompanied by some other gentlemen who
were being led to execution. Never shall
I forget the sight nor the look on the face
of my husband seeking his house for the
last time and asking himself what had befallen
his wife and daughter, while I, lest
I should sap his courage, could not call
out, &#8216;I am here!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The hours passed. The women were
driven out of the town and led like a herd
of cattle, along a road strewn with corpses,
to a distant meadow, where they were
penned until morning. The men were arrested
and their hands tied behind their
backs with copper wire so cruelly tightened
as to draw blood. They were gathered
into groups and made to lie down so that
their heads touched the ground and they
were unable to make any movement. The
night was spent in this way, with the town
burning and the pillage and orgy continuing.</p>

<p>Between five and six in the morning, the
military authorities decided that the executions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
should begin and that one of the
largest groups of prisoners, composed of
about a hundred civilians, should be present
at the death of the burgomaster, his
son and his brother. An officer informed
the burgomaster that his hour had come.
On hearing these words, a citizen of Aerschot,
Claes van Nuffel by name, went up
to the officer, begged him to spare the
chief magistrate&#8217;s life and offered to die
in his stead. He added that he was the
burgomaster&#8217;s political adversary, but that
he considered that, at this moment, M.
Tielemans was essential to the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the officer, harshly, &#8220;we
must have the burgomaster.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Tielemans stood up, thanked M.
van Nuffel and said that he would die with
an easy mind, as he had spent his existence
doing all the good in his power, and that
he would not beg for mercy. He entreated,
however, that the lives of his fellow-citizens
and of his son, a boy of fifteen
and his mother&#8217;s last consolation, might be
spared. The officer grinned and made no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
reply. The burgomaster&#8217;s brother next
asked for mercy, not for himself but for his
brother and his nephew. His request fell
on deaf ears. The lad then got up and
took his place between his father and his
uncle. Six soldiers took aim at ten yards&#8217;
distance; the officer lowered his sword;
and, as the widow of the heroic burgomaster
says, &#8220;the best man in this world had
ceased to exist.&#8221;</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>I will now quote from the evidence of
M. Gustave Nys, an eye-witness of the horrible
drama which nearly numbered him
among its victims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The other civilians were thereupon
placed in rows of three. The third in each
row was to leave it and fall out behind the
dead bodies, in order to be shot. All the
civilians had their hands tied behind their
backs. My brother and I stood next to
each other: I was number two; my brother
Omer, twenty years of age, was number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
three. I asked the officer, &#8216;May I change
places with my brother? It makes no difference
to you who falls under your bullets;
but it does to my mother, who is a
widow, for my brother has finished his
studies and is more useful to her than I
am.&#8217; Once again he refused to listen to
my prayer. &#8216;Fall out, number three!&#8217;
My brother and I embraced; and he joined
the others. There were thirty of them,
drawn up in line. Then a horrible scene
took place: the German soldiers, walking
slowly along the row, killed three at each
discharge of their rifles, waiting between
the volleys for the officer&#8217;s word of command.&#8221;</p>
</div>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>Incidents such as these would pass unperceived
if one did not take the trouble
to seek them out and to collect them piously
amid the huge mass of tragedies which for
more than four years upset and ravaged
the unhappy country tortured by its invaders.
Had they occurred in the history
of Greece or Rome, they would have found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
a place among the great deeds that honour
our earth and deserve to live for ever in
the memory of man. It is our duty to
make them known for a moment and to engrave
in our recollection the names of
those who were their heroes. Thus set
down, simply and plainly, as befits historic
truth, in depositions sworn under oath before
a nameless registrar who has stripped
them of any literary or sentimental embellishment,
they give at first but a very
faint idea of the intensity of the tragedy
and the value of the sacrifice. There is
here no question of a glorious death faced
amid the excitement of the fighting, on a
vast field of battle. Nor are we considering
an indefinite or overhanging menace,
or an uncertain, remote and perhaps avoidable
danger. We have to do with an obscure,
solitary, horrible and imminent
death in a ditch; and the six rifle-barrels
are there, aimed almost point-blank, ready,
upon a sign of the officer who accepts your
offer, to change you, in a second, into a
heap of bleeding flesh and to send you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
the unknown, terrible region which man
dreads all the more when he is still full of
strength and life. There is not a moment&#8217;s
interval nor a gleam of hope between
question and answer, between existence
with all its joys and death with all its
horrors. There is no encouragement, no
word or gesture of stimulation or support,
no reward; in an instant, all is given in exchange
for nothing; it is sheer self-sacrifice
standing naked and so pure that we are surprised
that not even Germans were conquered
by its beauty.</p>

<p>There was but one manner in which
they could have extricated themselves
without dishonour and that was to pardon
the two victims; or else, supposing the
thing which was not, which never is the
case, that a death was absolutely necessary,
there was a second solution, which was to
accept the offer and to kill the martyr
whom they ought to have worshipped on
their knees. In this way they would only
have acted as the worst of savages. But
they discovered a third, which doubtless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
before them, the Carthaginians alone
would have invented and adopted. For
that matter, they exceeded the fiercest savagery
and equalled the abominable Punic
morality in another case which brings to
mind that of Regulus and which will be the
third instance of heroism that I intend to
recall.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>A few days after the events which I
have narrated, on the 23rd of August,
1914, Dinant became the scene of wholesale
massacres which involved exactly six
hundred and six victims, including eleven
children under five years old, twenty-eight
of ages between ten and fifteen and seventy-one
women.</p>

<p>Nothing can give an idea of the horror
and infamy of these massacres, which form
one of the most disgraceful and terrible
pages in the long and monstrous history of
Teuton shame. But it is not my purpose
to speak of this for the moment. There
would be too much to tell. I wish to-day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
only to separate from the mass an episode
in which the hero of Dinant-la-Wallone is
worthy of a place beside his two brethren
of Aerschot in Flanders.</p>

<p>Just outside Dinant, near the famous
Roche &agrave; Bayard, the legendary glory of
the fair and smiling little township, the
Germans occupied the right bank of the
Meuse and were beginning to build a
bridge of boats. The French, hidden in
the bushes and the windings of the left
bank, were firing on the engineers. Their
fire was not very well-sustained; and the
Germans, without the least justification,
drew the conclusion that it was due to
<i>francs-tireurs</i>, who, for that matter,
throughout this Belgian campaign, never
existed except in their imagination. At
that moment, eighty hostages, taken from
among the inhabitants of Dinant, were
collected and kept in sight at the foot of
the rock. The German officer sent one of
them, M. Bourdon, a clerk attached to the
law-courts, to the left bank, to inform the
enemy that, if the firing continued, all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
hostages would be instantly shot. M.
Bourdon crossed the Meuse, fulfilled his
mission and pluckily returned to reconstitute
himself a prisoner. He assured the
officer that he had convinced himself that
there were no <i>francs-tireurs</i> and that only
French soldiers of the regular army were
taking part in the defence of the other
bank. A few more bullets fell; and the
officer caused the eighty hostages to be
shot, beginning, that he might be punished
as he deserved for his heroic faithfulness
to his pledged word, with the poor clerk,
his wife, his daughter and his two sons, one
of whom was a mere child of fifteen.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">UNDER the grey skies and the disheartening
rains of this autumnal
July, I think of the light which I have left
behind me. I have left it down there, on
the now empty shores of the Mediterranean,
and I ask myself in vain why I
parted from it. Yet I was one of the last
to tear myself away. All the others leave
in the early days of April, recalled by legendary
memories of the deceitful spring-tides
of the north, nor do they realize that
they are losing a great happiness.</p>

<p>It is good, it is wise to escape, amid the
blue of sea and sky, the icy months of our
winters, dismal as punishment; but, although
in the south these months are
warmer and above all more luminous than
ours, they do not quite make up to us for
the darkness and the frost of our native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
climes. The brightest and warmest hours,
in spite of all, retain an after-taste of cloud
and snow; they are beautiful, but timid;
swiftly and fearfully they hasten towards
the night. Now man, who is born of the
sun, like all things, has need of his hereditary
portion of primitive heat and all-pervading
light. He has within him numberless
deep-seated cells which retain the
memory of the resplendent days of the
prime and become unhappy when they cannot
reap their harvest of rays. Man can
live in the gloom, but at long last he loses
the smile and the confidence that are so essential.
Because of our twilit summers
it becomes indispensable to restore the balance
between darkness and light and sometimes
to drive away, by superb excesses of
sunshine, the cold and the dark that invade
our very souls.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>It reigns at a few hours&#8217; distance from
us, the incomparable steady sun which we
no longer see. Those who leave before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
mid-June do not know what happens when
they are gone. Lo and behold, the real
actors in this wonderful fairyland spring
up on every side as though they had been
awaiting the departure of intruding and
mocking witnesses. During the winter, in
the presence of the official visitors, they
have played but a tempered prologue, a
little colourless, a little slow, a little timid
and restrained. But now of a sudden the
great lyrical acts blaze forth upon the intoxicated
earth.</p>

<p>The heavens open their vistas to the uttermost
limits of the blue, to the supreme
heights where the glory and rapture of
God are outspread; and all the flowers
rend the gardens, the rocks and the
heaths, to uplift themselves and leap towards
the gulf of gladness which draws
them into space. The camomiles have
gone mad; for six weeks they hold outstretched,
to invisible lovers, their great
round clusters like shields of glowing snow.
The scarlet, tumultuous mantle of the
Bougainvilleas blinds the houses whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
dazzled windows blink amid the flames.
The yellow roses cover the hills with a
saffron-coloured cloak; the pink roses, of
the lovely, innocent pink of maiden
blushes, flood the valleys, as though the
divine well-springs of the dawn, which
elaborate the ideal flesh of women and
angels, had overflowed the earth. Others
climb the trees, scale pillars, columns,
house-fronts, porches, leap up and fall,
rise again and multiply, jostle one another,
lie one on top of the other, forming so
many bunches of effervescing delight, so
many silent swarms of impassioned petals.
And the innumerable, diverse and imperious
scents that flow through this ocean of
mirth, like rivers which do not mingle,
rivers whose source we recognize at every
breath! Here is the cold, green torrent
of the rose-geranium, the trickle of clove-carnations,
the bright, limpid stream of
lavender, the resinous eddy of the pine-barren
and the wide, still, luscious lake, of
an all but dizzy sweetness, of the orange-blossom,
which drowns the country-side in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
the vast, unmeasured fragrance of the
azure heavens, recognized at last.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>I do not believe that the world contains
anything more beautiful than those gardens
and valleys of the Proven&ccedil;al coast during
the six or seven weeks when departing
spring still mingles its verdure with the
first warmth of advancing summer. But
what gives this wonderful exultation of
nature a melancholy which we do not find
in any other spot is the inhuman and almost
painful solitude in which it is revealed.
Here, amid this desert, this silence, this
emptiness, from the vine-arbours to the
terraces and from the terraces to the
porches of a thousand abandoned villas,
reigns a rivalry of beauty which reaches a
poignant agony of intensity, exhausting
every energy, form and colour. There is
here a sort of magic password, as though
all the powers of grace and splendour that
nature holds concealed had united to give
at the same moment, to a spectator unknown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
to men, one great, decisive proof of
the blessings and the glories of the earth.
There is here a sort of unparalleled expectation,
awful and unendurable, which over
the hedges, the gates and the walls watches
for the coming of a mighty god; an ecstatic
silence which demands a supernatural presence;
a wild, exasperated impatience pouring
from every side over the roads where
nothing now passes save the mute and diaphanous
procession of the hours.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>Alas, how many beauties are wasted in
this world! Here is enough to feed our
eyes till death! Here is the wherewithal
to gather memories which would support
our souls even to the tomb! Here is that
which would provide thousands of hearts
with the supreme sustenance of life!</p>

<p>In the main, when we come to think of
it, all that is best in us, all that is pure,
happy and limpid in our intelligence and
our feelings, has its origin in a few beautiful
spectacles. If we had never seen beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
things, we should possess only poor
and ugly images wherewith to clothe our
ideas and emotions, which would perish of
cold and wretchedness like those of the
blind. The great highway which climbs
from the plains of existence to the radiant
heights of human consciousness would be
so gloomy, so bare and so deserted that
our thoughts would very soon lack the
strength and courage to tread it; and where
our thoughts no longer pass it is not long
before the briars and the cruel horrors of
the forest return. A beautiful spectacle
which we might have seen, which was ours,
which seemed to call us and from which
we fled can never be replaced. Nothing
more can grow in the spot where it awaited
us. It leaves in our soul a great barren
area, in which we shall find naught but
thorns on the day when we most need
roses. Our thoughts and our actions derive
their energy and their shape from the
things which our eyes have beheld. Between
the heroic deed, the duty accomplished,
the sacrifice generously accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
and the beautiful landscape which we have
seen in the past there is very often a closer
and more vital connection than that which
our memory has retained. The more we
see of beautiful things the better fitted we
become to perform good actions. If our
inner life is to thrive, we need a magnificent
store of wonderful spoils.</p>

<small>THE INSECT WORLD</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">HENRI FABRE, as all the world
now knows, is the author of half
a score of well-filled volumes in which, under
the title of <i>Souvenirs entomologiques</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
he set down the results of fifty years of observation,
study and experiment on the insects
that seem to us the best-known and
the most familiar: different species of
wasps and wild bees, a few gnats, flies,
beetles and caterpillars; in a word, all
those vague, unconscious, rudimentary and
almost nameless little lives which surround
us on every side and which we contemplate
with eyes that are amused, but already
thinking of other things, when we open our
window to welcome the first hours of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
spring, or when we go into the gardens or
the fields to bask in the blue summer days.</p>




<h3>2</h3>

<p>We take up at random one of these
great volumes and naturally expect to find
first of all the very learned and rather dry
lists of names, the very fastidious and exceedingly
quaint specifications of those
huge, dusty graveyards of which all the
entomological treatises that we have read
so far seem almost wholly to consist. We
therefore open the book without zest and
without unreasonable expectations; and
forthwith, from between the open leaves,
there rises and unfolds itself, without hesitation,
without interruption and almost
without remission to the end of the four
thousand pages, the most extraordinary of
tragic fairy plays that it is possible for the
human imagination, not to create or to conceive,
but to admit and to acclimatize
within itself.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is no question here of the
human imagination. The insect does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
belong to our world. The other animals,
the plants even, notwithstanding their
dumb life and the great secrets which they
cherish, do not seem wholly foreign to us.
In spite of all, we feel a certain earthly
brotherhood in them. They often surprise
and amaze our intelligence, but do
not utterly upset it. There is something,
on the other hand, about the insect that
does not seem to belong to the habits, the
ethics, the psychology of our globe. One
would be inclined to say that the insect
comes from another planet, more monstrous,
more energetic, more insane, more
atrocious, more infernal than our own.
One would think that it was born of some
comet that had lost its course and died demented
in space. In vain does it seize
upon life with an authority, a fecundity unequalled
here below: we cannot accustom
ourselves to the idea that it is a thought
of that nature of whom we fondly believe
ourselves to be the privileged children and
probably the ideal to which all the earth&#8217;s
efforts tend. Only the infinitely small disconcerts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
us still more greatly; but what
really is the infinitely small, other than an
insect which our eyes do not see? There
is, no doubt, in this astonishment and lack
of understanding a certain instinctive and
profound uneasiness inspired by those existences
incomparably better-armed, better-equipped
than our own, by those creature
made up of a sort of compressed energy
and activity in which we suspect our most
mysterious adversaries, our ultimate rivals
and, perhaps, our successors.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>But it is time, under the conduct of an
admirable guide, to penetrate behind the
scenes of our fairy play and to study at
close quarters the actors and supernumeraries,
loathsome or magnificent, as the case
may be, grotesque or sinister, heroic or appalling,
gifted or stupid and almost always
improbable and unintelligible.</p>

<p>And here, to begin with, taking the first
that comes, is one of those individuals, frequent
in the South, where we can see it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
prowling around the abundant manna
which the mule scatters heedlessly along
the white roads and the stony paths: I
mean the Sacred Scarab of the Egyptians,
or, more simply, the Dung-beetle, the brother
of our northern Geotrupes, a big
Coleopteron all clad in black, whose mission
in this world is to shape the more
savoury parts of his find into an enormous
ball which he must next roll to the underground
dining-room where the incredible
digestive adventure is to take its course.
But destiny, jealous of all undiluted bliss,
before admitting him to that abode of
sheer delight, imposes upon the grave and
probably sententious beetle tribulations
without number, which are nearly always
complicated by the arrival of an untoward
parasite.</p>

<p>Hardly has he begun, by dint of great
efforts of his forehead and his bandy legs,
to roll the toothsome sphere backwards,
when an indelicate colleague, who has been
awaiting the completion of the work, appears
and hypocritically offers his services.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
The other well knows that, in this
case, help and services, besides being quite
unnecessary, will soon mean partition and
dispossession; and he accepts the enforced
collaboration without enthusiasm. But,
so that their respective rights may be
clearly marked, the lawful owner invariably
retains his original place, that is to
say, he pushes the ball with his forehead,
whereas the compulsory guest pulls it towards
him on the other side. And thus it
jogs along between the two gossips, amid
interminable vicissitudes, flurried falls,
ludicrous tumbles, till it reaches the place
chosen to receive the treasure and to become
the banqueting-hall. On arriving,
the owner sets about digging out the
refectory, while the sponger pretends to go
innocently to sleep on the top of the bolus.
The excavation becomes visibly wider and
deeper; and soon the first Dung-beetle
dives bodily into it. This is the moment for
which the cunning auxiliary was waiting.
He nimbly scrambles down from the blissful
eminence and, pushing it with all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
energy that a bad conscience gives, strives
to gain the offing. But the other, who is
rather distrustful, interrupts his laborious
digging, looks over the edge, sees the
sacrilegious rape and leaps out of the
hole. Caught in the act, the shameless
and dishonest partner makes untold efforts
to play upon the other&#8217;s credulity, turns
round and round the inestimable orb and,
embracing it and propping himself against
it, with mock heroic exertions, pretends
to be frantically supporting it on a non-existent
slope. The two expostulate with
each other in silence, gesticulate wildly
with their mandibles and tarsi and then,
with one accord, bring back the ball to the
burrow.</p>

<p>It is pronounced sufficiently spacious and
comfortable. They introduce the treasure,
they close the entrance to the corridor;
and now in the propitious darkness and
the warm damp, where the magnificent
stercoral globe alone holds sway, the two
reconciled messmates sit down face to face.
Then, far from the light and the cares of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
day and in the great silence of the subterranean
shade, solemnly commences the
most fabulous banquet whereof abdominal
imagination ever evoked the absolute
beatitudes.</p>

<p>For two whole months, they remain
cloistered; and, with their paunches
gradually hollowing out the inexhaustible
sphere, definite archetypes and sovereign
symbols of the pleasures of the table and
the delights of the belly, they eat without
stopping, without interrupting themselves
for a second, day or night. And, while
they gorge, steadily, with a movement perceptible
and constant as that of a clock, at
the rate of three millimetres a minute, an
endless, unbroken ribbon unwinds and
stretches itself behind them, fixing the memory
and recording the hours, days and
weeks of the prodigious feast.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>After the Dung-beetle, that dolt of the
company, let us greet, also in the order of
the Coleoptera, the model household of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
<i>Minotaurus typhaeus</i>, who is pretty well-known
and extremely gentle, in spite of his
dreadful name. The female digs a huge
burrow which is often more than a yard
and a half deep and which consists of
spiral staircases, landings, passages and
numerous chambers. The male loads the
rubbish on the three-pronged fork that
surmounts his head and carries it to the
entrance of the conjugal dwelling. Next,
he goes into the fields in quest of the
harmless droppings left by the sheep, takes
them down to the first story of the crypt
and reduces them to flour with his trident,
while the mother, right at the bottom, collects
the flour and kneads it into huge
cylindrical loaves, which will presently be
food for the little ones. For three whole
months, until the provisions are deemed
sufficient, the unfortunate husband, without
taking nourishment of any kind, exhausts
himself in this gigantic work. At
last, his task accomplished, feeling his end
at hand, so as not to encumber the house
with his wretched remains, he spends his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
last strength in leaving the burrow, drags
himself laboriously along and, lonely and
resigned, knowing that he is henceforth
good for nothing, goes and dies far away
among the stones.</p>

<p>Here, on another side, are some rather
strange caterpillars, the Processionaries,
which are not rare; as it happens, a single
string of them, five or six yards long, has
just climbed down from my umbrella-pines
and is at this moment unfolding itself in
the walks of my garden, carpeting the
ground traversed with transparent silk, according
to the custom of the race. To
say nothing of the meteorological apparatus
of unparalleled delicacy which they
carry on their backs, these caterpillars, as
everybody knows, have this remarkable
quality, that they travel only in a troop,
one after the other, like Breughel&#8217;s blind
men or those of the parable, each of them
obstinately, indissolubly following its
leader; so much so that, our author having
one morning disposed the file on the
edge of a large stone vase, thus closing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
circuit, for seven whole days, during an
atrocious week, amid cold, hunger and unspeakable
weariness, the unhappy troop
on its tragic round, without rest, respite or
mercy, pursued the pitiless circle until
death overtook it.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>But I see that our heroes are infinitely
too numerous and that we must not linger
over our descriptions. We may at most,
in enumerating the more important and
familiar, bestow on each of them a hurried
epithet, in the manner of old Homer.
Shall I mention, for instance, the
Leucospis, a parasite of the Mason-bee,
who, to slay his brothers and sisters in
their cradle, arms himself with a horn
helmet and a barbed breastplate, which he
doffs immediately after the extermination,
the safeguard of a hideous right of primogeniture?
Shall I tell of the marvellous
anatomical knowledge of the Tachytes, of
the Cerceris, of the Ammophila, of the
Languedocian Sphex and many other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
wasps, who, according as they wish to
paralyse or to kill their prey or their
adversary, know exactly, without ever
blundering, which nerve-centres to strike
with their sting or their mandibles?
Shall I speak of the art of the Eumenes,
who transforms her stronghold into a complete
museum adorned with shells and
with grains of translucent quartz; of the
magnificent metamorphosis of the Grey
Locust; of the musical instrument owned
by the Cricket, whose bow numbers one
hundred and fifty triangular prisms that
set in motion simultaneously the four
dulcimers of the wing-case? Shall I sing
the fairy-like birth of the nymph of the
Onthophagus, a transparent monster,
with a bull&#8217;s snout, that seems carved out
of a block of crystal? Would you behold
the Flesh-fly, the common Blue-bottle,
daughter of the maggot, as she issues from
the earth? Listen to our author:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;She disjoints her head into two movable
halves, which, each distended with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
great red eye, by turns separate and reunite.
In the intervening space, a large,
glassy hernia rises and disappears, disappears
and rises. When the two halves
move asunder, with one eye forced back to
the right and the other to the left, it is as
though the insect were splitting its brain-pan
in order to expel the contents. Then
the hernia rises, blunt at the end and
swollen into a great knob. Next, the forehead
closes and the hernia retreats, leaving
visible only a kind of shapeless muzzle.
In short, a frontal pouch, with deep pulsations,
momentarily renewed, becomes the
instrument of deliverance, the pestle
wherewith the newly-hatched Dipteron
bruises the sand and causes it to crumble.
Gradually, the legs push the rubbish back
and the insect advances so much towards
the surface.&#8221;</p>
</div>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>And monster after monster passes, such
as the imagination of Bosch or Callot
never conceived! The larva of the Rosechafer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
which, though it has legs under
its belly, always travels on its back; the
Blue-winged Locust, unluckier still than
the Flesh-fly and possessing nothing
wherewith to perforate the soil, to escape
from the tomb and reach the light but a
cervical bladder, a viscous blister; and the
Empusa, who, with her curved abdomen,
her great projecting eyes, her legs with
knee-pieces armed with cleavers, her halberd,
her abnormally tall mitre, would
certainly be the most devilish goblin that
ever walked the earth, if, beside her, the
Praying Mantis were not so frightful that
her mere aspect deprives her victims of
their power of movement when she assumes,
in front of them, what the
entomologists have termed &#8220;the spectral
attitude.&#8221;</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>One cannot mention, even casually, the
numberless industries, nearly all of absorbing
interest, exercised among the
rocks, under the ground, in the walls, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
the branches, the grass, the flowers, the
fruits and down to the very bodies of the
subjects studied; for we sometimes find a
treble superposition of parasites, as in
the Oil-beetles; and we see the maggot itself,
the sinister guest at the last feast of
all, feed some thirty brigands with its
substance.</p>

<p>Among the Hymenoptera, which represent
the most intellectual class in the world
which we are studying, the building-talents
of our wonderful Hive-bee are certainly
equalled, in other orders of architecture,
by those of more than one wild and solitary
bee and notably by the Megachile, or
Leaf-cutter, a little insect which is nothing
to look at and which, to house its eggs,
manufactures honey-pots formed of a multitude
of disks and ellipses cut with
mathematical precision from the leaves
of certain trees. For lack of space, I am
unable, to my great regret, to quote the
beautiful and pellucid pages which Fabre,
with his usual conscientiousness, devotes
to the exhaustive study of this admirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
work; nevertheless, since the occasion offers,
let us listen to his own words, though
it be but for a moment and in regard to a
single detail:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;With the oval pieces, it becomes another
matter. What model has the
Megachile when cutting her neat ellipses
out of the delicate material for her wallets,
the robinia-leaves? What ideal pattern
guides her scissors? What system of
measurement tells her the dimension?
One would like to picture the insect as a
living pair of compasses, capable of tracing
an elliptic curve by a certain natural inflexion
of its body, even as our arm traces
a circle by swinging from the shoulder.
A blind mechanism, the mere outcome of
its organization, would alone be responsible
for its geometry. This explanation
would tempt me if the large oval pieces
were not accompanied by much smaller
ones, also oval, which are used to fill the
empty spaces. A pair of compasses which
changes its radius of its own accord and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
alters the curve according to the plan before
it appears to me an instrument somewhat
difficult to believe in. There must
be something better than that. The
circular pieces of the lid suggest it to us.</p>

<p>&#8220;If, by the mere flexion inherent in
her structure, the Leaf-cutter succeeds in
cutting out ovals, how does she manage to
cut out rounds? Can we admit the
presence of other wheels in the machinery
for the new pattern, so different in shape
and size? However, the real point of
the difficulty does not lie there. Those
rounds, for the most part, fit the mouth of
the jar with almost exact precision. When
the cell is finished, the bee flies hundreds
of yards away to make the lid. She arrives
at the leaf from which the disk is
to be cut. What picture, what recollection
has she of the pot to be covered? Why,
none at all: she has never seen it; she
does her work underground, in utter
darkness! At the utmost, she can have
the indications of touch: not actual indications,
of course, for the pot is not there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
but past indications, useless in a work of
precision. And yet the disk to be cut
out must have a fixed diameter: if it were
too large, it would not go in; if too small,
it would close badly, it would slip down
on the honey and suffocate the egg. How
shall it be given its correct dimensions
without a pattern? The bee does not
hesitate for a moment. She cuts out her
disk with the same celerity which she would
display in detaching any shapeless lobe
that might do for a stopper; and that
disk, without further measurement, is of
the right size to fit the pot. Let whoso
will explain this geometry, which in my
opinion is inexplicable, even when we allow
for memory begotten of touch and
sight.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Let us add that the author calculated
that, to form the cells of a kindred
Megachile, the Silky Megachile, exactly
1,064 of these ellipses and disks would be
required; and they must all be collected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and shaped in the course of an existence
that lasts a few weeks.</p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>Who would imagine that the Pentatoma,
on the other hand, the poor and evil-smelling
Wood-bug, has invented a really
extraordinary apparatus wherewith to
leave the egg? And first let us state that
this egg is a marvellous little box of snowy
whiteness, which our author thus describes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The microscope discovers a surface
engraved with dents similar to those of a
thimble and arranged with exquisite symmetry.
At the top and bottom of the
cylinder is a wide belt of a dead black; on
the sides, a large white zone with four big,
black spots evenly distributed. The lid,
surrounded by snowy cilia and encircled
with white at the edge, swells into a black
cap with a white knot in the centre. Altogether,
a striking burial urn, with the sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
contrast between the coal-black and the
fleecy white. The Etruscans would have
found a magnificent model here for their
funeral pottery.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The little bug, whose forehead is too
soft, covers her head, to raise the lid of the
box, with a mitre formed of three triangular
rods, which is always at the bottom of
the egg at the moment of delivery. Her
limbs being sheathed like those of a
mummy, she has nothing wherewith to put
her rods in motion except the pulsations
produced by the rhythmic flow of blood in
her skull and acting after the manner of a
piston. The rivets of the lid gradually
give way; and, as soon as the insect is free,
it lays aside its mechanical helmet.</p>

<p>Another species of bug, <i>Reduvius personatus</i>,
who lives mostly in lumber-rooms,
where she lies hidden in the dust, has invented
a still more astonishing system of
hatching. Here, the lid of the egg is not
riveted, as in the case of the Pentatomae,
but simply glued. At the moment of liberation,
the lid rises and we see:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;... a spherical vesicle emerge from
the shell and gradually expand, like a soap-bubble
blown through a straw. Driven
farther and farther back by the extension
of this bladder, the lid falls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the bomb bursts; in other words,
the blister, swollen beyond its capacity of
resistance, rips at the top. This envelope,
which is an extremely tenuous membrane,
generally remains clinging to the edge of
the orifice, where it forms a high, white
rim. At other times, the explosion loosens
it and flings it outside the shell. In those
conditions, it is a dainty cup, half spherical,
with torn edges, lengthened out below into
a delicate, winding stalk.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Now, how is this miraculous explosion
produced? Fabre assumes that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Very slowly, as the tiny creature takes
shape and grows, this bladder-shaped reservoir
receives the products of the work
of respiration performed under the cover
of the outer membrane. Instead of being
expelled through the egg-shell, the carbonic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
acid, the incessant result of the vital oxidization,
is accumulated in this sort of
gasometer, inflates and distends it and
presses upon the lid. When the insect is
ripe for hatching, a superadded activity in
the respiration completes the inflation,
which perhaps has been preparing since the
first evolution of the germ. At last, yielding
to the increasing pressure of the gaseous
bladder, the lid becomes unsealed.
The chick in its shell has its air-chamber;
the young Reduvius has its bomb of carbonic
acid: it frees itself in the act of
breathing.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>One would never weary of dipping
eagerly into these inexhaustible treasures.
We imagine, for instance, that, from seeing
cobwebs so frequently displayed in all manner
of places, we possess adequate notions
of the genius and methods of our familiar
spiders. Far from it: the realities of scientific
observation call for an entire volume
crammed with revelations of which we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
no conception. I will simply name, at
random, the symmetrical arches of the
Clotho Spider&#8217;s nest, the astonishing funicular
flight of the young of our Garden
Spider, the diving-bell of the Water Spider,
the live telephone-wire which connects
the web with the leg of the Cross Spider
hidden in her parlour and informs her
whether the vibration of her toils is due
to the capture of a prey or a caprice of the
wind.</p>

<p>It is impossible, therefore, short of having
unlimited space at one&#8217;s disposal, to
do more than touch, as it were with the tip
of the phrases, upon the miracles of maternal
instinct, which, moreover, are confounded
with those of the higher manufactures
and form the bright centre of the
insect&#8217;s psychology. One would, in the
same way, require several chapters to convey
a summary idea of the nuptial rites
which constitute the quaintest and most
fabulous episodes of these new Arabian
Nights.</p>

<p>The male of the Spanish Fly, for instance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
begins by frenziedly beating his
spouse with his abdomen and his feet, after
which, with his arms crossed and quivering,
he remains long in ecstasy. The newly-wedded
Osmiae clap their mandibles terribly,
as though it were a matter rather of
devouring each other; on the other hand,
the largest of our moths, the Great Peacock,
who is the size of a bat, when drunk
with love finds his mouth so completely
atrophied that it becomes no more than a
vague shadow. But nothing equals the
marriage of the Green Grasshopper, of
which I cannot speak here, for it is doubtful
whether even Latin possesses the words
needed to describe it seemingly.</p>

<p>All said, the marriage-customs are
dreadful and, contrary to that which happens
in every other world, here it is the
female of the pair that stands for strength
and intelligence and also for the cruelty
and tyranny which appear to be their inevitable
outcome. Almost every wedding
ends in the violent and immediate death of
the husband. Often, the bride begins by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
eating a certain number of suitors. The
prototype of these fantastic unions could
be supplied by the Languedocian Scorpions,
who, as we know, carry lobster-claws and
a long tail supplied with a sting, the prick
of which is extremely dangerous. They
have a prelude to the festival in the shape
of a sentimental stroll, claw in claw; then,
motionless, with fingers still gripped, they
contemplate each other blissfully, interminably;
day and night pass over their
ecstasy, while they remain face to face,
petrified with admiration. Next, the foreheads
come together and touch; the mouths&mdash;if
we can give the name of mouth to the
monstrous orifice that opens between the
claws&mdash;are joined in a sort of kiss; after
which the union is accomplished, the male
is transfixed with a mortal sting and the
terrible spouse crunches and gobbles him
up with gusto.</p>

<p>But the Mantis, the ecstatic insect with
the arms always raised in an attitude of
supreme invocation, the horrible <i>Mantis
religiosa</i> or Praying Mantis, does better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
still: she eats her husbands (for the insatiable
creature sometimes consumes
seven or eight in succession) while they
strain her passionately to their heart.
Her inconceivable kisses devour, not in a
metaphorical, but in an appallingly real
fashion, the ill-fated choice of her soul
stomach. She begins with the head, goes
down to the thorax, nor stops till she comes
to the hind-legs, which she deems too
tough. She then pushes away the unfortunate
remains, while a new lover, who
was quietly awaiting the end of the monstrous
banquet, heroically steps forward
to undergo the same fate.</p>

<p>Henri Fabre is indeed the revealer of
this new world, for, strange as the admission
may seem at a time when we think that
we know all that surrounds us, most of
those insects minutely described in the vocabularies,
learnedly classified and barbarously
christened, had hardly ever been
observed in real life or thoroughly investigated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
in all the phases of their brief and
evasive appearances. He has devoted to
surprising their little secrets, which are the
reverse of our greatest mysteries, fifty
years of a solitary existence, misunderstood,
poor, often very near to penury, but
lit up every day by the joy which a truth
brings, which is the greatest of all human
joys. Petty truths, I shall be told, those
presented by the habits of a spider or a
grasshopper. There are no petty truths
to-day; there is but one truth, whose looking-glass,
to our uncertain eyes, seems
broken, though its every fragment,
whether reflecting the evolution of a planet
or the flight of a bee, contains the supreme
law.</p>

<p>And these truths thus discovered had
the good fortune to be grasped by a mind
which knew how to understand what they
themselves can but ambiguously express,
to interpret what they are obliged to conceal
and, at the same time, to appreciate
the shimmering beauty, almost invisible to
the majority of mankind, that shines for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
a moment around all that exists, especially
around that which still remains very close
to nature and has hardly left its primeval
sanctuary.</p>

<p>To make of these long annals the generous
and delightful work of literature
that they are and not the monotonous and
arid record of finical descriptions and trivial
acts that they might have been, various
and so to speak conflicting gifts were
needed. To the patience, the precision,
the scientific minuteness, the protean and
practical ingenuity, the energy of a Darwin
in the face of the unknown, to the
faculty of expressing what has to be expressed
with order, clearness and certainty,
the venerable anchorite of S&eacute;rignan adds
many of those qualities which are not to
be acquired, certain of those innate good
poetic virtues which cause his sure and
supple prose, though a trifle provincial, a
trifle antiquated, a trifle primitive, to take
its place among the excellent prose of the
day, prose of the kind that has its own
atmosphere, in which we breathe gratefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
and tranquilly and which we find only in
masterpieces.</p>

<p>Lastly, there was needed&mdash;and this
was not the least requirement of the work&mdash;a
mind ever ready to cope with the riddles
which, among those little objects, rise
up at every step as enormous as those
which fill the skies and perhaps more numerous,
more imperious and more strange,
as though nature had here given a freer
scope to her last wishes and an easier outlet
to her secret thoughts. Fabre shrinks
from none of those boundless problems
which are persistently put to us by all the
inhabitants of that tiny world where mysteries
are heaped up in a denser and more
bewildering fashion than in any other.
He thus meets and faces, turn by turn, the
redoubtable questions of instinct and intelligence,
of the origin of species, of the
harmony or the accidents of the universe,
of the life lavished upon the abysses of
death, without counting the no less vast,
but so to speak more human problems
which, among infinite others, are inscribed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
within the range, if not within the grasp,
of our intelligence: parthenogenesis; the
prodigious geometry of the wasps and
bees; the logarithmic spiral of the snail;
the antennary sense; the miraculous force
which, in absolute isolation, without the
possible introduction of anything from the
outside, increases the volume of the Minotaurus&#8217;
egg tenfold, where it lies, and, during
seven to nine months, nourishes with
an invisible and spiritual food, not the
lethargy, but the active life of the scorpion
and of the young of the Lycosa and
the Clotho Spider. He does not attempt
to explain them by one of those generally-acceptable
theories, such as that of evolution,
which merely shifts the ground of the
difficulty and which, I may say in passing,
emerges from these volumes in a somewhat
sorry plight, after being sharply confronted
with incontestable facts.</p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>Waiting for chance or a god to enlighten
us, he is able, in the presence of the unknown,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
to preserve that great religious
and attentive silence which is dominant in
the best minds of the day. There are
those who say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you have reaped a plentiful
harvest of details, you should follow up
analysis with synthesis and generalize the
origin of instinct in an all-embracing
view.&#8221;</p>

<p>To these he replies, with the humble and
magnificent loyalty that illumines all his
work:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Because I have stirred a few grains of
sand on the shore, am I in a position to
know the depths of the ocean?</p>

<p>&#8220;Life has unfathomable secrets. Human
knowledge will be erased from the
archives of the world before we possess
the last word that a Gnat has to say to
us....</p>

<p>&#8220;Success is for the loud talkers, the
self-convinced dogmatists; everything is
admitted on condition that it be noisily proclaimed.
Let us throw off this sham and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
recognize that, in reality, we know nothing
about anything, if things were probed to
the bottom. Scientifically, Nature is a
riddle without a definite solution to satisfy
man&#8217;s curiosity. Hypothesis follows on
hypothesis; the theoretical rubbish-heap
accumulates; and truth ever eludes us.
To know how not to know might well be
the last word of wisdom.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Evidently, this is hoping too little. In
the frightful pit, in the bottomless funnel
wherein whirl all those contradictory facts
which are resolved in obscurity, we know
just as much as our cave-dwelling ancestors;
but at least we know that we do not
know. We survey the dark faces of all
the riddles, we try to estimate their number,
to classify their varying degrees of
dimness, to obtain an idea of their position
and their extent. That already is something,
pending the day of the first gleams
of light. In any case, it means doing in
the presence of the mysteries all that the
most upright intelligence can do to-day;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
and that is what the author of this incomparable
Iliad does, with more confidence
than he professes. He gazes at them attentively.
He wears out his life in surprising
their most minute secrets. He
prepares for them, in his thoughts and in
ours, the field necessary for their evolutions.
He increases the consciousness
of his ignorance in proportion to their importance
and learns to understand more
and more that they are incomprehensible.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;SEE no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,&#8221;
say the three sacred monkeys carved
over the gate of the Buddhist temple of
Iyeyasu at Nikko.</p>

<p>We all of us speak ill of one another:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;No one,&#8221; Pascal remarks, &#8220;speaks of
us in our presence as he does in our absence.
The union that exists among men
is based solely on this mutual deceit; and
few friendships would survive if each knew
what his friend says when he is not there,
though he be speaking of him in all sincerity
and without passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I lay it down as a fact that, if all men
knew what they say of one another, there
would not be four friends in this world.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>If you do away with evil-speaking, you
do away with three-fourths of our conversation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
and an unbearable silence will hover
over every gathering. Evil-speaking
or calumny&mdash;for it is extremely difficult
to separate the two sisters; and in reality
any evil-speaking is likely to be calumnious,
inasmuch as we know others even less well
than we know ourselves&mdash;evil-speaking,
which feeds all that creates disunion between
men and poisons their intercourse,
is nevertheless the chief motive that brings
them together and enables them to enjoy
the pleasures of society.</p>

<p>But the ravages which it wreaks all
around us are too well-known and have too
often been described to make it necessary
for us to portray them once again. Let
us here consider only the harm which it
does to him who indulges in it. It accustoms
him to see only the petty sides of men
and things; little by little it conceals from
him the bold outlines, the great unities, the
heights and depths containing the only
truths that count and endure.</p>

<p>In reality, the evil which we find in
others, the evil which we speak of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
exists within ourselves: from ourselves we
derive it; upon ourselves it recoils. We
perceive clearly only those defects which
are ours, or which we are on the point of
acquiring. Within ourselves is kindled
the evil flame whose reflection we perceive
on others. Each of us diligently searches
out, among those who surround him, the
vice or the defect that reveals to the clear-sighted
the vice or the defect to which he
himself is thrall. There is no more ingenuous
or intimate confession, even as
there is no better examination of conscience,
than to ask one&#8217;s self:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the fault which I most willingly
impute to my neighbour?&#8221;</p>

<p>You may be sure that this is the fault
which you are most inclined to commit and
that you most readily see what is happening
in the shallows to which you yourself
are descending. He who speaks ill of
others is, in short, merely his own traducer;
and evil-speaking is, in essence, but
the story of our own falls, transposed or
anticipated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span></p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>We surround ourselves with all the evil
that we attribute to the victims of our gossip.
It takes form at our own expense; it
lives and feeds upon the best of our substance;
it accumulates all about us, peopling
and encumbering our atmosphere
with phantoms, at first grotesque, inconsistent,
docile, timid and ephemeral, which
gradually become persistent, add to their
strength and stature, speak with louder
voice and develop into very real and imperious
entities which ere long will issue
orders and assume the direction of most of
our thoughts and actions. We are less
and less masters in our own houses; we feel
our character slowly sapped of its strength;
and we find ourselves sooner or later enclosed
within a sort of enchanted circle
which it is all but impossible to break, a
circle in which we no longer know whether
we are defaming our brethren because we
are growing as bad as they, or whether we
are growing bad because we defame them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>We should accustom ourselves to judge
all men as we judge the heroes of this
war. It is certain that, if any one had the
pitiful courage to undertake their belittlement,
he would find, in any gathering of
these men, almost as many vices, pettinesses
or blemishes as in any human gathering
chosen at random in any town or
village. He would tell you that it contained
hopeless drunkards, unscrupulous
libertines, uncouth, narrow and greedy peasants,
mean and rapacious shopkeepers,
callous, lewd and cheating artisans, sordid,
envious clerks and, among young men of
better birth, idle, presumptuous, selfish and
arrogant wastrels. He would add that
many of them did their duty only because
there was no way of avoiding it; that they
went forward, despite themselves, to brave
a death which they hoped to escape, because
they well knew that they could not
escape the death which would threaten
them if they refused to face the first. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
might say all this and many other things
which would appear more or less true; but
there is something far more true, which is
the great and magnificent truth that enfolds
and uplifts all the rest: it is the thing
which they really did; it is the fact that
they willingly offered themselves to death
in order to accomplish what they regarded
as a duty. It cannot be denied: if all those
who had vices and imperfections and the
desire to shun danger had refused to accept
the sacrifice, no force in the world could
have compelled them to it; for they would
represent a force at least equal to that
which would have sought to impel them.
We must therefore believe that these imperfections,
these vices, these ignoble desires
were very superficial and in any case
incomparably less powerful and less deeply
rooted than the great flood of feeling
which carried all before it. And this is
why, when we think of those dead or mutilated
heroes, the petty thoughts which I
have described do not even enter our
minds. And it is right that this should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
so. In the heroic whole they count for no
more than rain-drops in the ocean. All
has been swept away, all has been made
equal by sacrifice, suffering and death, in
the one untarnished beauty.</p>

<p>But let us not forget that it is almost
the same with all men; and that these heroes
were not of a different nature from
the neighbour whom we are incessantly
villifying. Death has purified and consecrated
them; but we are all of us daily in
the presence of the sacrifice, the suffering
and, above all, the death which will purify
and consecrate us in our turn. We are
almost all subject to the same ordeals
which, because they are less frequent and
less glorious, appeal no less to the same
profound virtues; and, if so many men,
chosen at hazard from among us, have
proved themselves worthy of our admiration,
it is because, after all, we are doubtless
better than we seem; for, while those
others mingled in our life, even they did
not appear to be much better than ourselves.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>PAULO MINORA.</i> This essay, I
need hardly say, consists of notes
made before the war and put in order now,
at a time when victory allows our thoughts
to stray for a moment from the great tragedy
in which the destinies of mankind
have been at stake. For the rest, the subject,
however frivolous it may at first sight appear,
sometimes touches or seems to touch
problems which it is not unfitting to examine,
were it only to realize that they are
perhaps illusive. Moreover it is unfortunately
probable that, when peace is restored,
our allies will visit in too numerous
and confiding crowds the dubious havens
of delight which we are about to enter. I
have no pretension to serve them as a guide
nor to teach them how to fight against the
whims of fortune; but a handful of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
may find in these lines, if not useful hints
or profitable advice, at least some few reflections
or observations which will pave
the way for their own experiments or render
them easier.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Let us then pay a last visit to one of
those green tables which spread their
length in the somewhat disreputable place
of which I have written elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as the
&#8220;Temple of Chance.&#8221; To-day I would
rather call it the Factory of Chance, for
it is here that, for more than half a century,
without respite or repose, on weekdays,
Sundays and holidays alike, daily
from ten o&#8217;clock in the morning till twelve
o&#8217;clock at night, with croupiers unintermittently
relieving one another, men have
obstinately manufactured Chance and doggedly
consulted the formless and featureless
god that shrouds good luck and ill
within his shadow.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>We do not yet know what he is nor what
he wants; we are not even sure that he
exists; but surely it would be astonishing
if no result of any kind, no clue to the
tantalizing puzzle, had emerged from this
endless effort, the most gigantic, the most
costly, the most methodical that has ever
been made on the brink of this gloomy
abyss, if nothing had been born of all this
furious work, however trivial, however
unhealthy and useless it may appear.</p>

<p>In any case, at these tables, as at all
places where passions become intensified,
we are able to make interesting observations
and, among other things, to behold
at first hand, violently foreshortened and
harshly illuminated, certain aspects of
man&#8217;s lifelong struggle with the unknown.
The drama, which as a rule is long drawn
out, projecting itself into space and time
and breaking up amid circumstances that
escape our eyes, is here knit together, gathered
into a ball, held, so to speak, in the
hollow of the hand. But, for all its speed,
its abruptness of movement and its extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
compression, it remains as complex
and mysterious as those which go on indefinitely.
Until the ivory ball that rolls
and hops around the wheel falls into its
red or black compartment, the unknown
veiling its choice or its destiny is as impenetrable
as that which hides from us the
choice or the destiny of the stars. The
movements of the planets can be calculated
almost to a second; but no mathematical
operation can measure or predict the
course of the little white ball.</p>

<p>Your most skilful players, indeed, have
given up trying. Not one of them any
longer seriously relies on intuition, presentiment,
second sight, telepathy, psychic
forces or the calculation of probabilities
in the attempt to foresee or determine the
fall of a destiny no larger than a hazel-nut.
All the scientific part of human knowledge
has failed; and all the occult and magical
side of that same knowledge has been
equally unsuccessful. The mathematicians,
the prophets, the seers, the sorcerers,
the sensitives, the mediums, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
psychometrists, the spiritualists who call
upon the dead for assistance, all alike are
blind, confounded and impotent before the
wheel and before Destiny&#8217;s thirty-seven
compartments. Here Chance reigns supreme;
and hitherto, though it all happens
before our eyes, though it is repeated to
satiety and may be held, let me say once
more, in the hollow of our hand, no one
has yet been able to determine a single one
of its laws.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>Yet such laws seem to exist; and thousands
of players have ruined themselves
in following their forms or their elusive
and deceptive traces. Let us take a bundle
of those records or <i>permanences</i>, published
at Monte Carlo, which give day by
day the list of all the numbers that have
come up at one of the roulette or <i>trente-et-quarante</i>
tables. As everybody knows,
these numbers are arranged in long parallel
columns, the black on the left and the
red on the right. When we look at one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
of these sheets, containing as a rule ten
columns of sixty-five numbers each&mdash;dead
and harmless cyphers now, though once so
dangerous, once destructive of so many
hopes and perhaps inspiring more than one
disaster&mdash;we observe a tendency towards
a fairly perceptible equilibrium between
the red and the black. Most often the
two chances balance each other, singly or in
little groups, a black, a red, two blacks,
three reds, three blacks, two reds and so
on. When we come upon a series of five,
six, seven, eight, sometimes eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve consecutive blacks, we are
almost certain of finding not far away a
compensating series of five, six, seven, eight
or ten reds. There is a very real rhythm,
a sort of breathing or a cadenced movement
to and fro of the mysterious creature
which we call Chance. This rhythm or
balance is moreover confirmed by the final
statistics of the day, from which we learn
that, in a total of six hundred and so many
spins of the ball, the difference between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
black and the red very seldom exceeds
twenty or thirty; and this difference is even
smaller in the total for the week, that is to
say, in a total of nearly five thousand spins,
when it is usually reduced to a few units.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>The monster has other strange habits.
We see, for instance, that it is not uncommon
for a number to come up twice in succession;
and it is undeniable that, in each
day&#8217;s play, two or three numbers are obviously
favoured, so much so that we may
hurl out a challenge to logic and declare
that the more frequently a number occurs
the more chances it has of reappearing.
This seems to conflict with the law of equilibrium
which we have remarked; but it
must be observed that this equilibrium will
be recovered later, that by the end of the
week the difference will no longer be very
great and that they will almost disappear
when the month is over. The equilibrium
is more slowly restored because we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
multiply the number of series by eighteen
and a half to reach the proportions of the
even chances.</p>

<p>Players note yet another law which, for
that matter, is but a corollary of the former
habit, but which has something curiously
human about it: the chances which lag behind
show a greater eagerness to regain
their lost ground at the moment that follows
more or less closely upon a halt, as
though they had recovered their breath
after a brief rest on the landing of a staircase.</p>

<p>Let us add at once that it is wise to distrust
these fluctuating habits and these gropings
after laws. For instance, red has
been known to beat black by seventy per
cent. in the course of a day&#8217;s play. Black,
on the other hand, as people still remember
at Monte Carlo, one day came up
twenty-nine times in succession and the
second dozen twenty-eight times without a
break. Chance has not our nerves; it is
not, like us, impatient to make good its
losses or to carry off its gains. It takes its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
time, awaits its hour and does not trouble
to keep step with our ways of life.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>Players as a rule attribute these habits
or caprices to a trick of the croupier&#8217;s hand.
This is hardly tenable. After all, we
know how the thing is done. The ball
drops into its compartment and the croupier
announces, for instance:</p>

<p>&#8220;13, black, <i>impair</i> and manque.&#8221;</p>

<p>The losses are raked in, the winnings are
paid out, the players renew their stakes,
there is sometimes a brief dispute, somebody
asks for change and so on. These
operations vary a good deal in length; and
all this time the wheel carrying the ball is
making hundreds of revolutions. The
croupier stops it at last, takes the ball, reverses
the wheel and sends the ball spinning
in the opposite direction. It is impossible
under these conditions for his particular
trick of the hand to exercise any
influence whatever. Besides, we can easily
see from the chart of the <i>permanences</i> that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
the change of croupier does not perceptibly
affect the rhythm of the even chances. It
is not the man who controls the rhythm but
the rhythm that controls the man.</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>These gropings after laws in what would
seem a negation of all or any law; these
strivings on the part of Chance to quit its
own domain and to organize its chaos; this
god who denies himself and seeks to destroy
himself by his own hand; these incomprehensible
stammerings, these awkward
efforts to achieve utterance and assume
consciousness are rather curious, we
must admit. For the rest, it is these efforts,
these hankerings after equilibrium,
this embryonic rhythm that constitute the
gamblers&#8217; good and bad luck. If Chance
were simply Chance as we conceive it on
first principles, one would stake any sum
anyhow and at any moment. I am well
aware that, according to the most learned
theorists on roulette, each <i>coup</i> is independent
of all the others and begins as if nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
had happened before, as if nothing
were to happen afterwards, as if the table
were fresh from the shop, the wheel from
the factory and the croupier from the
hands of God. In theory this is quite accurate;
but we have just seen that in practice
it does not seem to be so. For that
matter, it seems impossible to explain the
reason. Players are satisfied to observe
the fact, while yielding to a dangerous but
very human tendency to exaggerate the
scope and the certainty of their observations.</p>

<p>They are too ready to see laws where
there is only a mass of coincidences as
fleeting as clouds. It is of course necessary
that the reds and blacks, emerging
successively from nowhere, should find a
place somewhere and form certain groups;
and, if it is rather surprising that at the
end of the month their numbers are nearly
equal, it would be no less surprising if one
of the colours were to prevail largely over
the other. It is perfectly true that, at
first sight, the reds and blacks seem to balance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
on the <i>permanence</i> sheets; but it is
also true that, when we examine more
closely, a series of five or six reds, for
instance, interrupted by one or two blacks,
not infrequently begins a fresh run; and
ill-luck may well have it that, at this moment,
the player, in his search for equilibrium,
will start punting on the black and
in a few <i>coups</i> behold the disappearance of
all the winnings slowly and laboriously
wrested from Chance, which is niggardly
when one is winning and extremely generous&mdash;to
the bank&mdash;when one is losing.
For that matter, he will suffer the
same disappointment if he bets on the
variation, in other words, against the equilibrium,
and will too often discover that
these laws, when he puts his trust in them,
are writ in water, whereas they seem to be
graven in bronze so soon as they betray
him.</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>In order to profit by these laws, which
are perhaps fallacious and in any case untrustworthy,
and to secure himself against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
their treachery, he has contrived a host of
ingenious systems which sometimes enable
him to win but most often merely retard
his ruin.</p>

<p>But, before speaking of these systems,
let us begin by saying that we shall concern
ourselves here only with the even chances,
red or black, <i>pair</i> or <i>impair</i>, <i>passe</i> or
<i>manque</i>. These are sufficiently complicated
in themselves and set us problems
that would be enough to exhaust all the
shrewdness of a human life. As for any
other than the even chances, <i>en plein</i>, <i>&agrave;
cheval</i>, <i>transversales</i>, <i>carr&eacute;s</i>, <i>douzaines</i> and
so forth, these, both in theory and in practice,
escape all control, calculation or explanation.</p>

<p>Whatever system he adopt, the gambler
is always tossing heads or tails against the
bank. He has a chance and the bank has
a chance; but zero gives the bank odds
against him; and, though zero is apparently
a very mild tax, since at <i>rouge-et-noir</i> in
thirty-six chances the bank has only half
a chance more than the player, it is bound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
to be ruinous in the end. To escape the
abruptness of a decision which, if he placed
all that he possessed on the red or the
black, would end the game at a single
stroke, the player divides his stake, so as
to be able to defy a large number of
chances, hoping that, thanks to a skilfully
graduated progression, he will end by
lighting on a favourable series in which
the gains will exceed the losses. This is
the underlying principle of all the systems,
which are never anything but more or less
ingenious, prudent and complicated martingales.
There are not, there never will be
any others, in the absence of a miracle
which has not yet occurred, of an intuition
which foresees what the ball will decide, or
of an unknown force which will oblige it to
act as a player wishes.</p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>I have no intention of reviewing all
these systems, which are innumerable and
of unequal value: the <i>paroli</i> pure and simple,
that artless, violent, doubled stake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
which leads straight to disaster; the
D&#8217;Alembert and all its variants; the descending
progressions; the differential methods;
the <i>montant belge</i>; the <i>parolis intermittents</i>;
the snowball; the <i>photographie</i>;
the staking of equal amounts on
certain groups of figures, which is a Chinese
puzzle demanding days of patient observation
before it is attacked; and many
others which I forget, from the most clear-cut
to the most mysterious, which are sold
at a high price, to credulous beginners, in
sealed envelopes containing what is everybody&#8217;s
secret and with all or nearly all of
which I have become acquainted thanks to
the kindness of an erudite player. A detailed
account of those most frequently
used will be found in D&#8217;Albigny&#8217;s treatise
<i>Les Martingales modernes</i>, in Gaston Vessillier&#8217;s
<i>Th&eacute;orie des syst&egrave;mes g&eacute;om&eacute;triques</i>,
in Hulmann&#8217;s <i>Trait&eacute; des jeux dits de
hasard</i>, in Th&eacute;o d&#8217;Alost&#8217;s <i>Th&eacute;orie scientifique
nouvelle des jeux de la roulette,
trente-et-quarante, etc.</i>, and, above all, in
the <i>Revue de Monte Carlo</i>, which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
given a system in every issue since the day
of its foundation some fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>Whether mystic or transparent, all these
methods present more or less the same
dangers, being all founded on the quicksands
of equilibrium and temporary disturbance.
If they are very cautious, the
loss is trifling, but the gain is still smaller;
if they are bold, the gain is great, but the
loss is two or three times greater. The
best of them, in order to continue the defence
of a moderate stake and of what has
already been sacrificed, involve the risking
on the cloth, at a given moment, of all
the previous winnings, which are soon followed
by the sums held in reserve. This
is the inevitable revenge of the bank, at
which you thought that you were nibbling
with impunity, but which suddenly opens
wide its jaws, like a blind and drowsy
crocodile, and swallows profits and capital
at a single gulp.</p>


<h3>9</h3>

<p>The players hearten themselves by
maintaining that they have an incontestable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
advantage over the bank. They begin to
play, they &#8220;punt&#8221; when they like and as
they like and they withdraw when they
please, whereas the bank is compelled to
play without stopping, to accept every
stake and to meet every <i>coup</i> up to the
limit of the maximum, which, as we know,
is six thousand francs on the even chances.
This advantage is a real one if the player,
after winning a big sum, goes away and
does not come back again. But the lucky
gambler, even more infallibly than the one
who has no luck, will return to the enchanted
table and in so doing loses the
only elective weapon that he had against
his enemy. To choose your time for
punting is but an illusory privilege, because
everything, at any moment, is equally
shifting and uncertain; and you never
know beforehand when the precarious and
deceptive law of equilibrium will reassert
itself. After a long sequence of blacks,
you wager on a fine series of reds, a certain
run, you would say; but no sooner have
you staked your money than the series<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
gives up the ghost and remorseless black
resumes its devastating course; or else you
do the opposite: you bet on black and it is
red that settles down for a run. At whatever
moment you start punting, you are
always fighting red against black, that is to
say, one to one. Once more, the only real
advantage is that you can go away when
you like; but where is the gambler, whether
losing or winning, who is able to go away
and not come back?</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>After mature examination, all these systems
merely carve the brutal and crushing
mass of luck into small pieces. They act
as a defensive padding against the blows
of Chance, making them less grave. They
prolong the player&#8217;s life or his agony.
They enable the owner of a modest purse
to stake as often as the multimillionaire,
who would confine himself to betting double
or quits indefinitely, if he were not
stopped by the fatal barrier of the maximum.
But all mathematical operations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
all combinations of figures flutter and
struggle like blind captives between bronze
walls. They merely dash themselves in
vain against these walls, whether black or
red: both remain invulnerable and impregnable;
and from their imprisoning embrace
there is no escape.</p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>Does this mean that there is no such
thing as a defensible method and that the
most skilful calculations have not revealed
a means of defeating Chance? In theory,
I cannot bring myself to believe that baseless
calculations will ever do what they
have not done up to the present. It is
none the less true that, in practice, we
come upon some which struggle with fair
success against ill-luck. For instance, a
friend of mine, a British officer, has a system
which he has been using for a long
time and which yields astonishing results.
It is, of course, a progression, the whole of
whose virtue lies in an ingenious and very
simple key that seems to act as a sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
talisman. I have not found this method
in any of either the recognized or the
catchpenny treatises. It has its dangers,
like the others; it has its difficult moments,
when, to save your anticipated profits and
your earlier losses, you have to risk a
rather large amount. But, if you prudently
stop playing during runs which are
too obstinately hostile, if you allow the
storm to pass as it spreads over a large
number of chances, you end by obtaining
the necessary compensation. At any rate,
it has never seriously failed my friend so
far.</p>


<h3>12</h3>

<p>Nevertheless it must not be supposed
that we have only to use this system blindly
and automatically. As with other systems,
a certain science, a certain experience,
a certain deftness are indispensable.
Though science and experience are evasive
qualities here, fugitive and at the mercy of
Chance, they are by no means illusory.
The careful and experienced player understands
how to approach and nurse his luck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
or at least how not to thwart it. He
guesses the beginning and the end of a favourable
series. He foresees alternations
and intermittences; and, when he does not
succeed in grasping their rhythm, he prefers
to abstain from playing, rather than
encounter them inopportunely. He makes
more than one mistake, but makes far
fewer than those who, faithful to the very
scientific theory of the absolute independence
of each <i>coup</i>, back either colour at any
moment. He does not surrender to the
fixed rigidity of logic, he does not throw
the gauntlet down to fate, he does not
defy the animosity of fortune. He is
never obstinate. He does not struggle on,
sullenly, to his last coin, against an iniquitous
run, in order to gain the bitter satisfaction
of learning the utmost depths of
his ill-luck and the injustice of fate. He
has no self-conceit, no prejudices, no inflexible
opinions. He is docile, plastic and
accommodating. Devoid of all false
shame, he cheerfully abandons his pretensions
and pays court to fortune. He retraces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
his steps and retracts at fitting times.
He stops, starts afresh, yields, tacks about,
allows himself to be borne upon the tide
and comes safely to harbour, while the
arrogant, overbold and headstrong pilot
founders in deep water.</p>

<p>Beyond all else, he studies the character
and temper of the table at which he takes
his seat, for each table has its psychology,
its habits, its history, which vary from day
to day and yet by the end of the year form
a homogeneous whole wherein all temporary
errors, all anomalies and injustices are
compensated. The question is to know on
what page of this history he should prepare
to play his part. He will not learn
this at once. It is of little use for him to
peep at the notes and <i>permanences</i> of the
players who have come before him.
What he wants is the immediate contact,
the very breath of the hidden god. But
the god is already thrilling into life, taking
shape and countenance, giving a whispered
hint of his intentions, speaking words of
approval or condemnation; and the tragic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
struggle begins between the player, so infinitely
small, and Chance, so enormous
and omnipotent.</p>


<h3>13</h3>

<p>Now that the battle is joined, now that
the player has done what he could to summon
and welcome luck, there is nothing left
for him to do but wait; for luck, when all
is said, will remain the supreme power
that pronounces the final verdict, the formidable
and inevitable unknown factor in
every combination. The best of systems
cannot overcome an abnormal and pitiless
run of bad luck which makes you stake
incessantly on the losing colour. A run
like this, without favourable intermittences,
is extremely rare but always possible.
It corresponds, for that matter,
with the extraordinary strokes of good
luck, which seem more frequent only because
they attract more attention. From
time to time we see a man, or rather let me
say a woman&mdash;for it is nearly always
female players who have these inspirations&mdash;walk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
up to the table and with a high
hand and not the least hesitation gamble
<i>en plein</i> or <i>en cheval</i>, on a <i>transversale</i> or
<i>carr&eacute;</i>, and win time after time, as though
she saw beforehand where the ball would
fall. These moments of intuition are always
very brief; and, if the player insists
or grows stubborn, she will soon lose whatever
she has won. It is none the less true
that, when we observe this very obvious
and striking phenomenon, we wonder
whether there is not something more in it
than mere coincidence. When all is said,
can luck be anything other than a passing
and dazzling intuition of what will flash
into actuality before everybody&#8217;s eyes a
second later? Is not the compartment
which does not yet contain the little ball,
but which in an instant will snap it up and
hold it, is not this compartment already,
somewhere, a thing of the present and
even of the past? But these are questions
which would lead us too far afield in space
and time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>


<h3>14</h3>

<p>Be this as it may, to return to the system
of which we were speaking, even if I
were at liberty to divulge its secret I
should not do so. I am not a very austere
moralist and I look upon gambling as one
of those profoundly human evils which we
shall never be able to uproot and which,
for all our efforts, will always reappear
in a new form. Still, the least that we
can do is not to encourage it. The gambler,
I mean the inveterate, almost professional
gambler, is not interesting. To
begin with, he is an idler and nearly always
a part of the world&#8217;s flotsam, with
no justification for his existence. If he
be rich, he is making the most foolish, the
most dismal use of his money that can be
imagined. If he be poor, he is even less
easily to be forgiven: he should know better
than to sacrifice his days and too often
the welfare and the peace of mind of those
dependent on him to a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp.
Underlying the gambler we find too often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
a sluggard, an incompetent, a boneless
egoist, greedy of vulgar and unmerited
pleasures, a dissatisfied and inefficient individual.
Gambling is the stay-at-home,
imaginary, squalid, mechanical, an&aelig;mic
and unlovely adventure of those who have
never been able to encounter or create the
real, necessary and salutary adventures of
life. It is the feverish and unhealthy activity
of the wastrel. It is the purposeless
and desperate effort of the debilitated,
who no longer possess or never possessed
the courage and patience to make the honest,
persevering effort, the unspasmodic,
unapplauded effort which every human life
demands.</p>

<p>There is also a great deal of puerile
vanity about the gambler. Taken for all
in all, he is a child still seeking his place
in the universe. He has not yet realized
his position. He thinks himself peerless
in the face of destiny. In his self-infatuation
he expects the unknown or the unknowable
to do for him what it does not
do for any one whomsoever. And he expects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
this for no reason, simply because
he is himself and because others have not
that privilege. He must tempt fate incessantly,
hurriedly, anxiously, in I know
not what idle and pretentious hope of
learning to know himself from without.
Whatever fortune&#8217;s decision may be, he
will find cause for preening himself. If
he have no luck, he will feel flattered because
he is specially persecuted by fortune;
if he be lucky, he will think all the more
highly of himself because of the exceptional
gifts which she bestows upon him.
For the rest, he does not need to believe
that he deserves these gifts; on the contrary,
the less right he has to them, the
prouder he will be of them; and the unjust
and manifestly undeserved chance which
makes them his will form the best part of
the vainglorious satisfaction which he will
contrive to extract from them.</p>


<h3>15</h3>

<p>It would be extremely surprising, I said
when I began, if this indefatigable and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
exhaustive enquiry into Chance, pursued
for over fifty years, had failed to yield
some sort of result. I am wondering, at
the end of this investigation, what that
result is. At the cost of an insane waste
of money, time, physical, nervous and
moral energy and spiritual forces perhaps
more precious still, it has taught us that
Chance is in short Chance, that is to say,
an aggregate of effects whereof we do not
know the causes. But we knew as much
as this before; and our new discovery is a
little derisory. We have seen the shadowy
appearance of certain laws or habits
from which a few players appear to derive
advantage, though this advantage is always
precarious. But these apparent
laws, which tend obscurely and uncertainly
to instil a little order into Chance, are, like
Chance itself, but inconsistent and ephemeral
summaries of results from unknown
causes. Upon the whole we have learnt
nothing, unless perhaps it be that we were
wrong to attach greater importance to
those manifestations of destiny than they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
possess. If we look at them more closely,
we find that there is nothing more behind
all these catastrophes and all these mysteries
of luck than the catastrophe and the
mysteries which we put there. We link
our fate to the fate of a little ball which
is not responsible for it; and, because we
entrust it for a moment with our fortune,
we fondly imagine that mysterious moral
powers are bent on directing and ending
its course at the right or wrong moment.
It knows nothing of all this; and, though
the lives of thousands of men depended on
its fall to the right or the left of the point
at which it stops, it would not care. It
has laws of its own, which it must obey and
which are so complex that we do not even
try to explain them. It is just a little ball,
honestly seeking the little red or black hole
in which to go to sleep and having nothing
very much to tell us of the secrets of a
luck or destiny which exist only within ourselves.</p>

</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS war, which is one such as had
never yet been waged upon this
earth of ours, leads us to consider the
great problem of the future of mankind.</p>

<p>Dare we hope that humanity will one
day renounce these monstrous follies and
that they will become altogether impossible?
To this question, if we wish to meet
it at its source, I see but one reply, which
I have already given elsewhere and which
I will here recapitulate and complete,
namely, that we are engulfed in a universe
which has no more limit in time than it
has in space, which had no beginning, as
it will have no end, and which has behind
it as many myriads of myriads of years
as it discovers ahead of it. Yesterday&#8217;s
eternity and to-morrow&#8217;s are precisely identical.
All that the universe is going to do
it must have already done, for it has had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
as many opportunities of doing so as it
will ever have. All the things that it has
not done are things which it will never be
able to do, because nothing will be added,
in space or time, to what it has already possessed
in space or time. It has necessarily
made in the past all the efforts and all the
experiments which it will make in the future;
and all that has gone before, having
been subject to the same chances, is perforce
the same as all that is to follow.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>It is probable, therefore, that there was
once an infinity of worlds similar to our
own, even as it is likely that there is an
infinity of such similar worlds at present,
the infinity of space being comparable with
that of time. These coincidences, however
difficult for us to picture, must inevitably
occur and recur in the immeasurable
and the innumerous in which we are immersed,
that is, unless the infinity of possible
combinations be less unlimited than
those of time and space.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>This is where our capacity of imagination
halts, for it is easier for us to conceive
the infinities of space and time than
the infinity of combinations. To obtain
some idea of the latter, we should have to
understand the substance and the nature,
the laws and the forces, in a word, the
whole riddle of existence. None the less
is it true that this possible infinity of combinations
is our only hope; without it there
would be nothing more to expect of a universe
which obviously would have tried
and exhausted everything before our coming.</p>

<p>But, if this number of combinations is
really infinite, it is open to us to say that
the earth is an experiment which had not
yet been made and an experiment which
has failed, since suffering and evil have the
upper hand of happiness and goodness.
If the experiment has failed, we are its
victims; but we are not forbidden to hope
that our efforts will in some way modify
combinations which will be more fortunate
in other places or at another time. If the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
experiment has failed, it does not follow
that others have not succeeded and are not
more fortunate, at this very moment, in
other worlds than ours. We may even
suppose that, in the infinity of these combinations
and experiments, the most successful
tend to become fixed and crystallized
and that, in view of their infinite
number, they will bring about successfully
in the future what they have not brought
about successfully in the past. This is a
hazardous glimmer; but I doubt whether
any others will be discovered to keep us
uplifted above despair.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>Let us for a moment assume that the
experiment of this world had not miscarried
as it has; that the mind of man, which,
since the beginning, has been struggling
painfully against matter and winning but
a few brief, uncertain and precarious victories,
were a million times more powerful
and better-armed. It would no doubt
have triumphed over all that weighs us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
down and keeps us where we are; it would
have freed itself from the apparently illusory
fetters of space and time. It is not
unreasonable to admit that, among the
myriads of worlds which people the infinite,
there are some in which these better
conditions are realized. Perhaps, after
all, it would be impossible to imagine anything
that does not exist somewhere in
reality, for we may very rightly maintain
that our imaginings can be nothing more
than stray reflections of things that already
exist. Now, if we lived in one of those
worlds and if we could see, as we should
perhaps be allowed to see, all that is happening
at this moment on the earth which
we now inhabit and on others which are
perhaps even worse and more unfortunate,
it seems to us that we should know neither
rest nor ease until we had intervened and
helped to make it better and wiser and
more habitable.</p>

<p>For that matter, no one can tell us that
this is not so now and that all our spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
victories, all that seems, at certain moments,
to be leading us towards a future
less hideous than the past, all the mysterious
currents of good that sometimes flow
through our world, all that awaits us after
death, no one, I say, can tell us that all
this is not due to the intervention of one
of those worlds. It is true that we cannot
perceive the act of intervention, that
we are hardly sensible of it; but it is also
true that these creatures of a higher world,
being of necessity less encumbered with
matter and more spiritual than we, must
necessarily remain invisible to us. In the
infinity of the firmament we discover myriads
of worlds that are material worlds
like our own; and we are able to discover
only these, because all that does not more
or less closely resemble our own world
must needs escape us. But the space lying
between the stars, which to us appears
void, is infinitely wider than the space
which they themselves occupy; and it would
be strange indeed if it were not filled with
worlds which we cannot perceive at all, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
rather if it were not itself one vast world
which our eyes are incapable of taking in.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, thinkable that, if we
do not see these other worlds, they, not
being material worlds, do not perceive
matter and are consequently as unaware
of us as we are unaware of them; for we
are doubtless mistaken in believing that,
because we are visible to one another, we
are necessarily visible to all other beings.
On the contrary, there is reason to presume
that these spiritual beings pass
through us without suspecting our presence
and that, as they are conscious and sensible
only of that which emanates from the
spirit, they do not suspect or discover our
existence except in so far as we approach
the conditions in which they exist.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>Consider the earth in its origin: at first,
a shapeless nebula, becoming gradually
more and more condensed; next, a globe
of fire, of rocks in fusion, whirling for
millions of years through space, with no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
other object than that of forming into a
mass and cooling: an inconceivable incandescence,
which none of our sources of
heat can enable us to picture; an essential,
scientific, absolute barrenness which may
well have proclaimed itself irremediable
and everlasting. Who would have
thought that from these torrents of matter
in eruption, which seemed to have destroyed
for ever all life or the least germ
of life, there would emerge each and every
form of life itself, from the most enormous,
the strongest, the most enduring, the
most impetuous, the most abundant, down
to the slightest, the least visible, the most
precarious, the most ephemeral, the most
exiguous? Who above all could have
dared foresee that they would give birth to
what seems so utterly alien to the liquefied
or pasty rocks and metals that alone
formed the surface, the nucleus and the
very entity of our globe, I mean our human
intelligence and consciousness?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>Is it possible to imagine a more unexpected
evolution and ending? What
could astonish us after so great an astonishment
and what are we not entitled to
hope of a world which, after being what
it was, has produced what we see and what
we are? Considering that it started from
a sort of negation of life, from integral
barrenness and from worse than nothing,
in order to end in us, where will it not end
after starting from ourselves? If its
birth and formation have elaborated such
prodigies, what prodigies may not its existence,
its indefinite prolongation and its
dissolution hold in store for us? There
are an immeasurable distance and inconceivable
transformations between the one
frightful material of the early days and
the human thought of this moment; and
there will doubtless be a like distance and
like transformations as difficult to conceive
between the thought of this moment
and that which will succeed it in the infinity
of time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>It seems as if, in the beginning, our
earth did not know what to do with its
material and with its force, which inter-devoured
each other. In the vast, flaming
void in which it was being consumed, it had
not yet the shadow of an object or an idea;
to-day, it has so many that our scholars
wear out their lives to no purpose in seeking
them and are overwhelmed by the
number of its mysterious and inexhaustible
combinations.</p>

<p>At that time it disposed of but a single
force, the most destructive that we knew,
fire. If everything was born of fire, which
itself seemed to be born only to destroy,
what will not be born of that which seems
to be born only to produce, beget and multiply?
If it was able to do so much with
the lava and the red-hot cinders which were
the only elements that it possessed, what
will it not be able to do with all that it will
end by possessing?</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>It is well sometimes to tell ourselves that
we are at least living in a world which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
not yet exhausted its future and which is
much nearer to its beginning than to its
end. It was born only yesterday and has
but lately disentangled its original chaos.
It is at the starting-point of its hopes and
its experiments. We believe that it is
making for death, whereas all its past, on
the contrary, shows that it is much more
probably making for life. In any case,
as its years pass by, the quantity and still
more the quality of the life which it engenders
and maintains tend to increase and
to improve. It has given us only the first-fruits
of its miracles; and in all likelihood
there is no more connection between what
it was and what it is than there will be between
what it is and what it will be. No
doubt, when its greatest marvels burst into
being, we shall no longer possess the lives
which we possess to-day; but we shall still
be there under another form, we shall still
be existing somewhere, on its surface or
in its depths; and it is not utterly improbable
that one of its last prodigies will
reach us in our dust, awaken us and recall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
us to life, in order to impart to us at last
the share of happiness which we had not
enjoyed and to teach us that we were
wrong not to interest ourselves, on the
further side of our graves, in the destiny
of this earth of ours, of which we had
never ceased to be the immortal offspring.</p>

<small>THE TWO LOBES</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">A SOLDIER writes me the following
letter from the front:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;There are quagmires and skeletons in
the forest. I have discovered and admired
the ruined gods under the still living
and wonderful vegetation: their spirit has
evaporated. The odour of Christ has little
charm for me; I prefer that of Buddha.
What I adore in him is the fundamental
contradiction that seeks to assure us of our
immortality by proving our inevitable annihilation.
He taught, in the same breath,
the illusion of the Ego and its periodical
reincarnation, an obvious absurdity which
implies a knowledge of the profoundest
truth, of the very nature of being, at the
same time and alternately collective and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
individual. This discovery, which he did
not formulate, should have led him elsewhere
than to Nirvana, that paradise of
unripe fruits....</p>

<p>&#8220;Man is so fashioned as to perceive
only one half of the universe; and the
mind of ordinary texture sees barely a
hemisphere of truth. Afflicted with a congenital
&#8216;nervous headache,&#8217; humanity
thinks with only one half of its brain, with
the eastern lobe or the western, the ancient
or the modern; its mind nibbles its own
tail; the antinomies pursue one another in
an endless circle, which Kant believed that
he had discovered, but which Buddha had
striven to open. He possessed the complementary
virtues; he was religious and
rational; while he summed up within himself
the mysticism of the east, his was the
most scientific of the minds of antiquity, at
a time when science did not exist but was
merged in philosophy. The moderns who
have sought to condense into a system the
collective and hardly initiated effort of
science have pitiably failed, for they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
thought only as westerners, entangled in
the contradiction of idealistic aspirations
and materialistic arguments, whereas
Buddha&#8217;s formula might still and almost
without breaking down contain this gigantic
effort and yet not hamper it. From
the death of the prince-philosopher, down
to the flights of contemporary science, true
thought has not advanced one step; Arab
or Christian spiritualism and its reagent,
positivist or scientific materialism, are recoils
in contrary directions, false monisms
which, taking the extreme for the supreme,
seek to fix the centre of gravity on the circumference
of the wheel. The explorers
of the Beyond must set out from the cross-roads
of religious synthesis and scientific
analysis and drag these rival sisters by the
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Truth shines at the centre of a circle of
onlookers and we must pass through its
flame to recognize a brother in the adversary
opposite. We must reach the centre
of space to discern the identity of its cardinal
points: &#8216;<i>Totum et Nihil, Alter et<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
Ego</i>.&#8217; The longing to convert others must
yield to the need of completing and balancing
our own point of view. In the sacred
forest, which pioneers have penetrated
on all sides and in all ages, the more
greatly daring must necessarily draw
nearer one to the other. Even if they
cannot meet, they can hear one another
and give one another mutual encouragement.
The most modest cry of discovery
may be welcome in the solitude and silence
in which the truth of the future is ripening....&#8221;</p>
</div>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>I thought it well to preserve this page.
It sets forth, in a remarkable, though perhaps
too rapid summary, two or three of
the great problems which in reality are
only one and to which, unless we give up
everything, we are bound to attempt the
answer: the problems of immortality or
annihilation, of flux and reflux, of existence
alternatively collective and individual,
of exteriorization and interiorization,
which make up the mighty cosmic rhythm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
whereof our life and death are but infinitesimal
pulsations.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>But let us begin by observing that the
fundamental contradiction which seeks to
assure us of our immortality by proving
our inevitable annihilation is not to be
found in Buddha and that it is not true to
say that he teaches in the same breath the
illusion of the Ego and its periodical reincarnation.
The doctrine of reincarnation
is not Buddha&#8217;s. He found it ready-made;
it existed before him and was so
deeply rooted in his people that he does
not even dream of disputing it. From the
exoteric point of view, he tries only to disarm
it, to deprive it of its sting, to render
it harmless. He tries to reduce life to the
point where it can find nothing wherewith
to reincarnate itself. According to the
exoteric doctrine, which is but a preparation
for esoteric truth, life is naught but
suffering; and its only aim is the redemption
or the extinction of suffering. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
extinction is to be found in Nirvana, which
is not annihilation but the absorption of
the individual into the universe. Ordinary
death, by reason of the perpetual
reincarnation of the same individual, cannot
suppress suffering. We must therefore
find a sort of superdeath, which
makes any reincarnation impossible; and
this superdeath can be obtained only by
the man who has been striving to die all
his life long and who has deliberately cut
off all the ties that bind him to existence:
all love, all hope, all desire, all possession.
When, at the end of this systematic and
voluntary superdeath, the actual death arrives,
it will no longer find a living germ
capable of achieving reincarnation. This
superdeath, thus obtained, will precede by
many centuries or millenaries purification,
final redemption and the absorption into
the absolute One.</p>

<p>It has been said that this is exactly the
reverse of the doctrine of Christ. With
Buddha, life is only the gate of death; with
Christ, death is the gate of life. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
reality, it is the same thing and everything
ends by the absorption into the divine, for
the doctrine of Christ is nothing more
than a mutilated branch of the great trunk
of the mother religion.</p>

<p>Here we have the solution offered to us
by the most wonderful mind, the greatest
sage that humanity has ever known; by
one who knew things which we no longer
know and which, it may be, we shall never
recover. It is the foundation of the religion
of five hundred millions of men.
There is nothing nearer to the ultimate
truth.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>Let us observe, however, that the problem
of immortality or annihilation ought
not to be set in these terms, since the word
annihilation cannot be employed, save in a
metaphorical sense, to denote a life which
we no longer comprehend, seeing that
Nihil or nothingness is the one thing whose
existence is utterly impossible and whose
non-existence is absolutely certain.</p>

<p>As for immortality, here again there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
ambiguity, for, as annihilation cannot exist,
immortality is inevitable; and the only
question that remains to be solved is
whether this immortality will or will not
be accompanied by some sort of continuance
of our present consciousness.</p>

<p>But, while it is probable that the problem
of immortality, more or less accompanied
by consciousness, will long remain
in suspense, the answer to the problem
of the &#8220;nervous headache,&#8221; or rather of
congenital hemiphlegia, is doubtless easier
to find. In any case, it occupies a domain
which our direct investigations are able to
explore. It is, after all, an historical and
geographical question. It seems that
there are in fact in the human brain an
eastern lobe and a western lobe, which
have never acted at the same time. The
one produces, here, reason, science and
consciousness; the other secretes, yonder,
intuition, religion and subconsciousness.
One reflects only the infinite and the unknowable;
the other is interested only in
what it is able to delimit, in what it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
hope to understand. They represent, employing
a perhaps imaginary image, the
conflict between the material and the moral
ideal of humanity. They have more than
once endeavoured to penetrate each other,
to mingle and to work in concert; but the
western lobe, at least over the most active
part of the world, has hitherto paralysed
and almost annihilated the efforts of the
other. We are indebted to it for extraordinary
progress in all the material sciences,
but also for such catastrophes as
those which we are undergoing to-day, catastrophes
which, if we are not careful,
will not be the last nor the worst. The
time would seem to have come to awaken
the paralysed lobe; but we have neglected
it so greatly that we no longer quite know
what it is capable of doing.</p>

</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE same soldier, who has become my
war-time &#8220;god-child,&#8221; writes to me
again:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I experience an ineffable delight in remaining
the average man and in professing
emptiness. I felt a great peace descend
within me on the day when I resigned myself
to the common lot, in other words, to
ignorance and death. I have found life
by renouncing it and, now that I am no
longer anything, I feel rich indeed. Do
not tempt me in the direction of that subtle
spiritual vanity which constitutes one of
the most formidable obstacles to the final
liberation from self. Proud I certainly
was and I am still only too much so; but
we cannot extract virtues otherwise than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
from our vices. More ardently than when
I embraced the phantom of individual superiority,
I stretch my arms towards homogeneous
equality, towards the fullness of
vacancy....&#8221;</p>
</div>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>He is right; but he is thinking, here, with
the eastern lobe of his brain, the Asiatic
lobe; and the philosophy of this lobe counsels
only inaction and renunciation, the
&#8220;enchantment of the disenchanted,&#8221; as
Renan used to say, or rather the satisfaction
of despair. Certainly all we that
see, all that we feel and all that we know
pledges us to this despair, which our meditations&mdash;above
all, those of this same
Asiatic lobe&mdash;may, for that matter, render
very spacious and as beautiful, almost
as habitable, as hope. But what do we
know, as compared with what we do not
know? We are ignorant of all that goes
before and of all that comes after us, in
a word, of the whole universe. Our despair,
which appears at first the last word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
and the last effort of wisdom, is therefore
based upon what we know, which is nothing,
whereas the hope of those whom we
believe to be less wise can be based upon
what we do not know, which is everything.</p>

<p>Moreover, if we would be quite just,
there is more than one reason for hoping
which we will not recall here; let us confess
therefore that in this nothing which
we know there exists naught but despair
and that hope can lie only in that everything
which we do not know. But, instead
of listening only to our eastern lobe,
which counsels us to accept this inactive
ignorance and to bury our lives therein,
is it not more reasonable at the same time
to set our western lobe to work, the lobe
which seeks to discover that everything?
It is possible that here too, when all is
said, it will find despair; but it is unlikely,
for we cannot imagine a world which
would be merely an act of despair. Now,
if the world is not an act of despair, nothing
that exists in it has reason to despair.
In any case and in the meanwhile, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
search will doubtless permit us to hope
as long as the world exists.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>One of the most dangerous temptations
that assail him who scrutinizes nature and
who sees, as he advances in his enquiries,
that her mysteries become more and more
numerous, reaching forth unendingly in
every direction, is the temptation to grow
discouraged by the impossible task and to
abandon it. He drops his weapons. On
the last slope of life particularly, he is too
much inclined to resign himself, to go no
farther forward, to make no further effort,
to fall into a humour of saying,
&#8220;What is the good?&#8221; and to drop asleep
and learn nothing more, since he has learnt
that he will never know anything.</p>

<p>He is already sensible of this wish to
surrender at discretion when he considers
the humblest, the lowliest of the sciences.
What will it be when he attempts to embrace
them all? The mind goes astray,
becomes dizzy, asks to close its eyes. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
must not close them. That would be the
basest treachery that man could commit.
We have no other thing to do in this life
of ours than to seek to know where we are.
We find no other reason for our existence;
we have no other duty. Not to know is
merely vexatious; no longer to seek to
know is the supreme, the irremediable misfortune,
the unpardonable desertion.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>Yet, without renouncing, it is not well
that we should feed ourselves upon too
petty illusions. We should always keep
before our eyes certain verities which put
us in our place. There is no doubt that
we shall never know everything; and so
long as we do not know everything we
shall be just as though we knew nothing.
It is extremely possible, as the Rig-Veda
suggests, that God Himself, or the first
cause, does not know everything. It is
equally possible that the universe has not
yet, in any of its parts, become conscious
of itself; that it knows not whence it came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
nor whither it is going, what it was nor
what it will be, what it has accomplished
nor what it is seeking to accomplish; and,
on the other hand, it is probable that, if it
has not yet learnt these things, it will never
learn them, seeing that, as I have already
said, there is no reason why it should be
able, in the infinity of time which will come
after us, to do what it has not been able
to do in the infinity of time which went
before.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>If there be a consciousness of the universe,
a God, He knows all that He should
know, or He will never know it. And,
if He knows it, why has He done what He
has done, which cannot lead to anything,
seeing that He might already have led us
where we ought to go? Why did He not
prefer nothingness, or at least that which
we call nothingness, the only form of lasting
happiness, immovable, incontestable
and comprehensible?</p>

<p>We could understand, if need were, an
immobile, immutable, eternal universe, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
finished universe; but we cannot understand
a universe in movement, or one, at
least, of which all the parts that we see are
incessantly in movement, evolving through
space and time, a universe hurling itself at
a dizzy rate of speed towards an end
which it will never attain, since it has not
yet attained it.</p>

<p>We may say, to console ourselves, that
all despair comes only from the limited nature
of our purview; but it is fair to add
that our purview limits all hope in the same
way.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE biologists tell us that the human
embryo repeats, very rapidly during
the early months of its development and
more slowly during the later months, all
the forms of life which preceded man upon
this earth.</p>

<p>The round speck which is the germ becomes
a hollow sphere, a sort of sac with
a double wall, which is known as the gastrula
and whose orifice of invagination,
when it closes, receives the name of the
blastopore. This is protozoic life, the as
yet gelatinous beginning of animal life, and
is followed, after transformations that
would take too long to enumerate, by polypoid
life.</p>

<p>Next, on either side of the head, appear
the branchial arches, corresponding with
the gills of the fish. At the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
first month, the limbs are still no more
than mere buds; on the other hand, the
embryo is provided with a tail, which,
folded against the body, nearly touches the
forehead. It now has the appearance of
a tadpole and lives a life which is wholly
aquatic, bathed in the amniotic fluid which
represents for it the water in which the
embryos of fish and frogs move about
freely.</p>

<p>It now becomes a matter of forming a
resolution and knowing what to do with it.
The embryo is almost in the situation occupied
by life at the origin of the species;
and nature, as though to humiliate man or
to humiliate herself by remembering her
mistakes and hesitations, returns to her
gropings, her asymmetrics, her repentances,
her unsuccessful experiments. Tentative
forms, such as the dorsal cord, are
reabsorbed; the primitive kidneys disappear,
to make room for the final kidneys,
which are enormous, filling the greater
portion of the peritoneal cavity. Enormous
too is the liver, which invades almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
the whole of the visceral cavity; enormous
the head, almost as large as the rest of
the body; and in this enormous head the
primitive ocular vesicles are formed, themselves
enormous, as is the umbilical vesicle.
This is the incoherent and monstrous period
corresponding with the period of madness
and gigantism when nature, as yet inexperienced,
was blindly sketching uncertain
creatures, formidable, unbalanced and
anomalous, birds, crocodiles, elephants and
fish in one, as though she had not as yet
decided what to do, not yet completed her
classifications, disentangled her laws, or
acquired the sense of proportion, of balance,
or of conditions essential to the
maintenance of the life which she was creating.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>This, roughly speaking, is the recapitulation
which occurs before our eyes, but of
which, no doubt, many incidents escape us
or do not sufficiently attract our attention,
for it is possible that they reproduce types<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
with which we are not acquainted and
which have not even left geological traces,
seeing that the number of species which
have disappeared is infinitely greater than
that of the species which we know.</p>

<p>Dr. H&eacute;lan Jaworski may therefore very
justly assert that the embryonic period
corresponds with the geological period.
And, even as, in the great terrestrial evolution,
we observe the gradual disappearance
of the armour-plated fishes, the monstrous
reptiles and the gigantic mammals,
so, in the minor embryonic evolution, we
see the primitive kidney, the dorsal cord
and the umbilical vesicle dissolve, while
the liver diminishes and the disproportion
between the head and the rest of the body
is lessened. In a word, nature is learning
wisdom, recognizing her errors, profiting
by her experience, doing her best to repair
her blunders and acquiring a sense of
equilibrium, economy and form.</p>

<p>Dr. Jaworski finds other analogies between
the geological period corresponding
with man&#8217;s appearance upon earth and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
birth of the child, analogies which are ingenious,
but rather more hazardous.
Birth is in fact preceded by a miniature
deluge, caused by the tearing of the foetal
envelopes, which allow the amniotic fluid
to escape. Then the child, at the moment
of entering into life, suddenly experiences
a sort of glacial period; it passes, in
fact, from an environment with a temperature
of over 98&deg; to the outer air, which
is barely 60&deg; or 65&deg;. The sense of cold is
so terrible that it wrests a first cry of suffering
from the new-born child.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>What is the meaning of this strange recapitulation?</p>

<p>Dr. Jaworski thinks that, if the brief
process of embryonic evolution which prepares
the way for the birth of man repeats
the great process of terrestrial evolution,
this latter, on its side, might well be but
a vast embryonic period that is preparing
for a birth which we cannot as yet imagine.
I do not know whether he will succeed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
maintaining this stupendous theory. If
he does, he will really have made us, as
he promises to do, &#8220;take a step towards
the essence of things.&#8221; Meanwhile, thanks
to his preparatory studies, he will always
have made us take another and a very useful
step towards a truth which this time
is incontestable, which, though less unexpected,
has never been elucidated with so
much patience and which is no less big with
consequences.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>Dr. Jaworski, then, undertakes to
demonstrate that the human body unites
in itself, in a plainly recognizable form, all
the living creatures which now exist upon
earth and which have existed since the
origin of life. In other words, each creature
sums up in itself all those which have
preceded it; and man, the last-comer, contains
within himself the whole biological
tree, so much so that, if we could distribute
his body, if we could segregate each of
his organs and keep it alive in isolation, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
should be able to reconstitute all existing
forms, to repeople the earth with all the
species which it has borne, from the
primitive protoplasm to the synthesis, the
final achievement, which is man.</p>

<p>We might perhaps go farther than Dr.
Jaworski and declare, with the occultists
of the east, that we likewise contain within
us, in the germ or in a rough-hewn state,
all the creatures and all the forms that will
come after us. But here we should be
leaving the domain of science proper to
lose ourselves in a speculation which by
its very nature is incapable of verification.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>So it is not merely in a figurative sense,
such as that foreshadowed by the current
idiom, where it speaks of the vascular
tree, the branches of nerves, or the ovarian
cluster; it is not merely by analogy, but
in a literal and strictly scientific sense that
our heart, fundamentally, is nothing but
a medusa and our kidneys sponges, that
our intestines represent the polyps and our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
skeleton the polypites, that our reproductive
organs are worms or molluscs, that the
vertebral column and the spinal marrow
take the place of the Echinodermata, while
the Brachiopoda and the Ctenophora
would be derived from our eye and the
reptiles found in our digestive apparatus,
the birds in our respiratory organs and so
on.</p>

<p>I repeat, there is no question here of
metaphors or of more or less approximate,
elastic and plausible correspondences but
of rigorously and meticulously established
proofs.</p>

<p>I cannot, of course, set before you the
details of Dr. Jaworski&#8217;s exegesis. It
would not permit of the slightest solution
of continuity and, in the three volumes published
so far, it leads us to conclusions
which are very difficult to contest. People
used to assert, without attaching too much
faith to what they said or scrutinizing it
too closely, that man is a microcosm. It
seems to be clearly proved to-day that this
is not merely literally defensible, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
scientifically accurate. We are a prehistoric
colony, immense and innumerous,
a living agglomeration of all that lives, has
lived and probably will live upon earth.
We are not only the sons or brothers of
the worms, the reptiles, the fish, the frogs,
the birds, the mammals and no matter what
monsters have defiled or affrighted the
surface of the globe: we bear them within
us; our organs are no other than themselves;
we nourish all their types; they are
only awaiting an opportunity to escape
from us, to reappear, to reconstitute themselves,
to develop and to plunge us once
again into terror. In this respect, quite
as much as in respect of the secret
thoughts, the vices and the phantoms with
which we are filled, we might repeat the
words which Emerson&#8217;s old man used to
speak to his children, when they were
frightened by a strange face in the dark
passage:</p>

<p>&#8220;Children, you will never see anything
worse than yourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>If all the species were to disappear and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
only man remained, none would be lost
and all might be reborn of his body, as
though they were coming out of Noah&#8217;s
ark, from the almost invisible protozoa
down to the formidable antediluvian
colossi which could lick the roofs of our
houses.</p>

<p>It is therefore fairly probable that all
these species take part in our existence, in,
our instincts, in all our feelings, in all our
thoughts; and here once more we are led
back to the great religions of India, which
foresaw all the truths that we are gradually
discovering and which already, thousands
of years ago, were telling us that man is
everything and that he must recognize his
essence in every living creature.</p>

<small>HEREDITY AND PREEXISTENCE</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE law of heredity which insists that
the descendants shall suffer by the
faults and profit by the virtues of their
ancestors comprises truths that are no
longer disputed. They shine forth, visible
to the eyes of all. The child of a
drunkard will bear the burden of his
father&#8217;s vice all his life long, from the day
of his birth to that of his death, in body
and in mind. One might say that by this
irrefutable example nature had intended
ostentatiously to affirm and manifest the
implacable character of her law, as though
to make us understand that she takes no
account whatever of our conceptions of
justice and injustice and that she acts on an
unvarying principle in all the obscure circumstances
in which we cannot follow the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
inextricable windings of her will. This
example, if we had no other, would be
enough to brand that inhuman will with
infamy. There is no law more repugnant
to our reason, to our sense of responsibility,
nor one which does a deeper injury
to our trust in the universe and the unknown
spirit that rules it. Of all life&#8217;s
injustices, this is the most glaring and the
least comprehensible. For most of the
others we find excuses or explanations; but,
when we remember that a new-born child,
a child which did not ask to be born, is,
from the moment of inhaling its first breath
of air, smitten with irremediable insolvency,
with a ferocious, irrevocable sentence
and with evils which it will drag to
the grave, it seems to us that not one of
the most hateful tyrants that history has
cursed would have dared to do what nature
does quietly every day.</p>

<p>But do we really bear the burden of
the errors of the dead? In the first place,
is it quite certain that the dead are really
dead and no longer dwell within us? It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
is a fact that we continue them, that we
are the durable part of what they were.
We cannot deny that we are still subject
to their influence, that we reproduce their
features and their characters, that we
represent them almost entirely, that they
continue to live and to act in us; it is therefore
very natural that they also should
continue to bear the consequences of an
action or a way of living which their departure
has not interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; you may say, &#8220;I had no part in
this action, this habit, this vice for which
I am paying to-day. I was not consulted;
I had no opportunity of uttering a protest,
of checking my father, or my grandfather,
as he went to his ruin down the
fatal precipice. I was not born; I did not
yet exist!&#8221;</p>

<p>How do you know? May there not be
a fundamental mistake in the idea of
heredity as we conceive it? At one end
of the beam of those scales which we accuse
of injustice hangs heredity, but the
other is borne down by something different,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
which we have never taken into
account, for it has not yet a name, something
which is the antithesis of heredity,
which cleaves into the future instead of
emerging from the past and which we
might call preexistence or prenatality.</p>

<p>Even as our dead still live in us, so we
have already lived in them. There is no
reason to believe that the future, which is
full of life, is less active and less potent
than the past, which is full of the dead.
Instead of descending, should we not
rather ascend the course of the years to
discover the source of our actions?</p>

<p>We know not in what fashion those already
dwell in us who shall be born of us,
down to the last generation; but that they
do dwell in us is certain. Whatever the
number of our descendants, in the sequence
of the ages, whatever the transformations
which the elements, climates, countries and
centuries may cause them to undergo, they
will keep intact, through all vicissitudes,
the principle of life which they have derived
from us. They have not obtained it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
elsewhere or they could not be what they
are. They have really issued from us;
and, if they have issued from us, it is
because they were in us from the first.
What were they doing within us, all these
innumerable, accumulated lives? Is it
permissible to suppose that they were absolutely
inactive? Then what were their
functions, what their power? What
divided them from us? When did we begin,
where did they end? At what point
did their thoughts and their desires mingle
with ours?</p>

<p>&#8220;How could they think and act in us,&#8221;
you ask, &#8220;having as yet no brain?&#8221;</p>

<p>True; but they had ours. The dead too
are without a brain; nevertheless no one
will deny that they continue to think and
act in us. This brain of which we are so
proud is not the source but the condenser
of thought and will. Like the Leyden jar
or the Ruhmkorff coil, it exists, it is
animated only so long as the electric fluid
of life passes through it or resides in it.
It does not produce this fluid, it collects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
it; what matters is not its convolutions,
which may be compared with the windings
of an induction-coil, but the life that flows
through it; and what can this life be, if it
be not the sum of all the existences which
are accumulated within us, which are not
extinguished at our death, which begin before
our birth and which continue us, forwards,
and backwards, into the infinity of
time?</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Writers of essays and novels have at
times endeavoured to represent these diverse
lives which we harbour within us;
and each of us, if he question himself sincerely
and profoundly, will discover in himself
two or three clearly-defined types,
which have nothing in common but the
body in which they reside, which rarely
agree among themselves, which are incessantly
striving to gain the upper hand and
which put up with one another as best they
can, in order to go through an existence
whose aggregate forms our ego. This
ego will be good or bad, remarkable or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
insignificant, more or less generous or selfish,
calm or uneasy, pacific or pugnacious,
heroic or pusillanimous, hesitating or decided
and enterprising, brutal or refined,
crafty or loyal, active or idle, chaste or
lascivious, modest or vainglorious, proud
or obsequious, unreliable or steadfast, according
to the authority which the type
that captures the best positions of the heart
or brain is able to assume over the others.
But, even in the life that appears the most
stable, the most homogeneous, the best-balanced,
this authority will never be final
or undisputed. The dominant type will
find itself for ever disputed, attacked,
thwarted, disturbed, circumvented, harassed,
tempted, deceived, betrayed and
sometimes cunningly dethroned by one of
the rival or subordinate types which it
failed to distrust or which it did not watch
narrowly enough. We behold unexpected
coalitions, fantastic compromises, regrettable
defections, fierce competitions, incessant
intrigues and positive revolutions,
especially at the critical periods and at each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
moment of important happenings; and all
this prodigious inward tragedy does not
cease for an instant until the hour of
death.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>But, once again, why seek only in the
past and among our ancestors for the
actors in this drama which is the essential
drama of humanity? What justification
have we for supposing that the dead alone
play all the parts? Why should those
from whom we have issued possess more
influence than those who will issue from
us? The first are remote from our bodily
selves, they are separated from us by unfathomable
mysteries and their survival
may perhaps be called in question; the
others inhabit our flesh and their existence
is incontestable. We have just seen that
the argument deduced from the absence
of any brain is not invincible.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; you will perhaps go on to say,
&#8220;how do you suppose that, when they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
not yet lived, they can possess habits, virtues
and vices, preferences and experience,
in a word, all that constitutes a character
and cannot be acquired save by contact with
life?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the same objection could be raised,
in most cases, with regard to our ancestors.
Generally speaking, when we issued from
them, they were still young; they were not
yet what they became and what we shall
become after them. They had not yet
adopted the habits, the ways of thinking or
feeling, or cultivated the virtues or the
vices which are reproduced in us. The
stubborn little mediocrity whom we all feel
within us, frugal, cautious and shabby in
his dealings, was still perhaps a prodigal,
high-spirited and reckless youth; the rake
was still perhaps chaste, the thief had
never stolen and the murderer may have
had a horror of bloodshed. All this is
almost equally immaterial and equally potential
in both cases; the only present
points at issue are the amorphous tendencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
and forces whereon the brain which
we receive from these and pass on to those
bestows a form.</p>

<p>It is therefore very possible that the little
mediocrity, the rake, the thief or the
murderer, far from being dead, are not yet
born and are taking as active a part as our
ancestors in the agitations and sometimes
in the conduct of our existence. This is
what the most ancient and the most
venerable religions of humanity always
foresaw or revealed, receiving it perhaps
on the authority of an unknown and loftier
source; and of these religions Christianity,
with its dogma of original sin, is but an
imperfect echo. Even to-day, more than
six hundred millions of human beings believe
in the preexistence of the soul, in
successive lives and in reincarnation. In
the eyes of these religions, the little
mediocrity who begot us several centuries
ago is the same who, a little less paltry, a
little less narrow, improved by his previous
life and his passage through the mysteries
of death, is awaiting within us the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
of rebirth and who, while waiting, shares
our instincts, our feelings and our thoughts.
He does not wait in solitude; he is but one
life in the host of lives which have preceded
us and which come back to live in us
again; and all these past and future lives
form the sum total of our own.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>We will not here discuss this doctrine
of successive lives and of the expiatory and
purifying reincarnation, which is the noblest
and, up to now, the only acceptable
explanation of nature&#8217;s injustices that has
been discovered. In the present state of
our knowledge, it can be only a magnificent
theory or a statement impossible
of proof. Let us not forsake the indisputable
ground on which heredity and
preexistence have their being. Heredity is
an acquired fact, an experimental truth;
preexistence is a logical necessity. It is
not indeed possible to conceive that what
will be born of us does not already exist
within us in fact, in principle, in the germ,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
in essence or in potentiality; and, from the
moment of its existence in a fashion probably
more spiritual than material, it is
far less surprising that it should be more
or less responsible for thoughts and actions
to which it could not be wholly a stranger.</p>

<p>In any case, heredity, which is incontestable,
and preexistence, which is necessary,
remind us yet once again that each
of us is not a single being, isolated, permanent,
hermetically sealed, independent of
others and separated from all things in
time and space, but a porous vase dipping
into the infinite; a sort of cross-roads,
where all the paths of the past, the present
and the future meet; an inn beside the
eternal highways, where all the lives which
make up our own foregather for a few
days&#8217; sojourn. We believe ourselves dead
when they leave the inn; and we fancy that
they too have perished. It is more likely
that this is not so at all. They are merely
quitting the ruined hostel to install themselves
in a new and more habitable house.
They carry with them their debts and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
obligations; they remove to their new
abode their instincts, their habits, their
ideals, their passions also, their merits and
their faults, their acquisitions and their memories.
The house is different, but the
guests are the same; and the old life will
resume its course in the new dwelling and
will be perhaps a little nobler, perhaps a
little fairer, perhaps filled with a little
brighter light.</p>

<small>THE GREAT REVELATION</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">WE despair of ever knowing the
origin of the universe, its aim, its
laws, or its intentions; and we end by
doubting whether there be any. It were
wiser very humbly to confess that we are
not able to conceive them. It is probable
that, if the universe to-morrow were to
yield us the key of its riddle, we should
be as incapable of understanding how to
use it as is a dog to whom we show the
key of a clock. In revealing its great secret
to us, it would teach us hardly anything;
or at least the revelation would
have but an insignificant influence upon our
life, our happiness, our ethics, our efforts,
and our hopes. It would soar at such
heights that no one would perceive it; at
most it would disencumber the sky of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
religious illusions, leaving only the infinite
void of the ether in their place.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>For that matter, there is no saying but
that we once possessed this revelation. It
is highly possible that the religions of nations
which have disappeared, such as the
Lemurians, the Atlanteans and many
others, were aware of it and that we have
discovered its remains in the esoteric
traditions that have come down to us. It
must not indeed be forgotten that there
exists, side by side with the outward,
scientific history, a secret history of mankind
which derives its substance of legends,
myths, hieroglyphics, strange monuments
and mysterious writings from the hidden
meaning of the primitive books. One
thing is certain, that, though the imagination
of those who interpret this occult
history is often venturesome, all that they
declare is not to be despised and deserves
to be examined more seriously one day
than has hitherto been done.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>The essence of this esoteric revelation
is very well summed up by M. Marc
Saunier, a disciple of Fabre d&#8217;Olivet and
Saint-Yves d&#8217;Alveydre, in his book, <i>La
L&eacute;gende des symboles</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The Initiates,&#8221; he says, &#8220;have always
regarded each continent as a being subject
to the same laws as man. For them, the
minerals constitute its skeleton, the flora
its flesh, the fauna its nerve-cells and the
human races the grey matter of its brain.
This continent itself is but an organ of the
earth, wherein each man is treated as a
thinking cell and whereof the thought is
represented by the sum of human thoughts.
The earth itself is but an organ of the
solar system, which in turn is considered as
an individual; and our solar system thus becomes
merely an organ of another being
of the infinite, whose heart would appear
in the star Alpha in Aries. And lastly,
by a final synthesis, we come to the Cosmos,
which expresses the general sum of
all things, in a being whose body is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
world and whose thought is the universal
intelligence, exalted by the religions to the
rank of a deity.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The basis of their doctrine is plainly
evolutionistic. Each continent has merely
transformed, in its own time and according
to its own ideal, the seeds which came
from the Hyperborean tracts; and man is
but the result of an animal evolution. For
the rest, they borrow it in part from the
Hindus, thus anticipating by many thousands
of years the latest hypotheses of our
modern science.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>But, without loitering in these shifting
sands, let us go direct to clear and reliable
sources. We possess, in the sacred and
secret books of India, of which we know
only an infinitesimal part, a cosmogony
which no European conception has ever
surpassed. It would not be correct to say
that it attained, at the first endeavour, the
ultimate limits beyond which the mind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
man could not venture without dissolving
in the infinite, for it was the work of centuries
of which we do not know the tale;
but it indisputably preceded all the others,
its birth was earlier than anything that we
know and, at the beginning of all things, it
exceeded in grandeur all that we have
learnt and all that we can imagine.</p>

<p>It was the first, for instance, long before
our historic periods, to give us a dizzy
yet concrete idea of the infinity of time.
The Book of Manu teaches us that twelve
thousand years of mortals are but a day
and a night to the gods; their year, therefore,
consisting of three hundred and sixty
days, numbers 4,320,000 years. A thousand
years of the gods make but one of
Brahma&#8217;s days, that is to say, 4,320,000,000
human years, representing the total life of
our globe; and Brahma&#8217;s night is of equal
duration. Three hundred and sixty of
these days and nights make one of this
god&#8217;s years; and a hundred of these years
constitute one of his lives, that is to say,
the duration of the universe, which is represented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
by the formidable figure of 311,090,000,000,000
years. After this he begins
a new life. At present we have not
yet attained the noon of Brahma&#8217;s actual
day nor half the life-time of our terrestrial
globe.</p>

<p>To complete this outline of the stupendous
chronology of the Vedas, I continue
to profit by some notes received from my
war-time godson, who has a thorough
knowledge of this unduly neglected science.
For the rest, it will be seen that chronology
and cosmogony are here in intimate connection:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The day of Brahma (4,320,000,000
years) is divided into fourteen lives of
Manu, consisting alternately of seven
Manvantaras and seven Pralayas. The
word Manvantara signifies the interval between
two Manus: one of these appears
in the dawn and the other in the twilight of
this period of terrestrial activity. The
morning Manu gives the Manvantara its
name and the evening Manu presides over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
the Pralaya, that is to say, the period of
dissolution, or negative <i>status quo</i>, death,
sleep, or inertia, as the case may be, which
divides two waves of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Universal evolution is a chain without
beginning or end, each link of which in
turn appears and disappears in our field
of consciousness. Brahma himself dies
only to be reborn. But for the sovereign
of the worlds, as for a random star or the
least of organized creatures, there is death
and dissolution only from the individual
point of view. Darkness is the ransom
to be paid for light, the evening balances
the morning, age is the price of youth and
death the reverse of life. In reality, however,
all evolution is at the same time continuous
and discontinuous; the Manvantaras
and Pralayas are at once simultaneous
and successive; each individual life is engendered
by its elemental double and engenders
its residual double. Every decline
of life in a given place coincides with
an increase of being in a corresponding
place and proceeds by means of a rebirth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
in a fresh place. Fundamentally, there is
no individual life. We are at once ourselves
and another, ourselves and several
others, ourselves and all others, ourselves
and the Universe, ourselves and infinity.</p>

<p>&#8220;The evolution of our terrestrial globe
is an infinitesimal cycle of this universal
evolution, corresponding merely with a day
and a night of Brahma, and is divided into
fourteen cycles, each consisting of a
Manvantara and a Pralaya. The cycle
of organic evolution upon our solidified
globe represents only one of these subdivisions,
that is to say, the radius of the
organic sphere is only a fourteenth part
of the radius of the mineral sphere. Mineral
evolution is manifestly continuous
from the formation of the globe to its dissolution.
If, between the periods of geological
activity, there exists a Pralaya of
any kind, this latter, despite the etymology
of the word, must be not a dissolution,
which would be perfectly inconceivable
from the logical and scientific point of
view, but a period of inertia or abatement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
of which the hypothesis is readily
admissible and of which the glacial periods,
occurring in the very course of the present
Manvantara, afford us an example. In
the earlier cycles of Manu, the earth
passed in succession through the various
stages of condensation which science regards
as igneous and which correspond
with the ethereal, gaseous and liquid evolution
of the elements. During these long
periods, the life of the present existed potentially
in the soul of the earth and actually
on other globes than ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>But we will proceed no further with this
outline, which would become so complicated
as to be inextricable. Let us remember
simply the magnificent doctrine of the
reincarnation, which is the most ancient
reply, the only decisive and, no doubt, the
most plausible reply, to all the problems
of justice and injustice, the immortal torture
of mortals, and its corollary, the law
of Karma, which, as my godson so truly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
says, &#8220;is the most wonderful of ethical
discoveries: it represents abstract liberty
and is enough to enfranchise the human
will from any superior or even infinite being.
We are our own creators and the
sole captains of our fate; no other than
ourselves rewards or punishes us; there
is no sin, but only consequences; there is
no morality, but only responsibilities.
Now Buddha taught that, merely by virtue
of this sovran law, the individual must be
reborn to reap what he has sowed; and this
certainty of rebirth was enough to neutralize
the horror of death.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Is all this nothing more than imagination,
than the dreams of brains more
ardent than our own, the hallucinations of
ascetics which amaze the young and the
immobility or the echo of immemorial
traditions bequeathed by other races, or by
races anterior to man and more spiritual?
It is impossible to decide; but, whatever
its origin, it is certain that the monument
whereof we have seen but a corner of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
pedestal is prodigious and that it has not a
human aspect. All that we can say is that
our modern sciences, notably arch&aelig;ology,
geology and biology, confirm rather than
invalidate either of these revelations.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>But this is not the question for the moment.
Let us suppose that one of these
revelations, for instance, that of the sacred
books of India, were true, incontestable
and scientifically proved by our researches;
or that an interplanetary communication or
a declaration of some superhuman being
no longer permitted us to doubt its
authenticity: what influence would such a
revelation have upon our life? What
would it transform in our life, what novel
element would it add to our morality or
our happiness? No doubt it would work
but a very slight change. It would pass
too high above us; it would not descend
to our level; it would not touch us; we
should lose ourselves in its immensity; and
upon the whole, knowing everything, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
should be neither happier nor wiser than
when we knew nothing.</p>

<p>Not to know what he has come upon this
earth to do: that is man&#8217;s great and everlasting
torment. Now we must perforce
admit that the actual truth of the universe,
if some day we learn it, will probably be
very similar to one or other of those
revelations which, while appearing to
teach us everything, teach us nothing at all.
It will at least possess the same inhuman
character. It will necessarily be as unlimited
in both space and time, as abysmal,
as foreign to our senses and our brain.
The more tremendous, the more majestic
the revelation, the greater chance will it
have of being true; but also, the more remote
from us it is, the less will it interest
us. We can hardly hope to escape
from this discouraging dilemma: those
revelations, explanations or interpretations
which are too petty will not satisfy us, because
we shall instinctively feel them to be
insufficient; while those which are too great
will pass us by too far to affect us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span></p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>It nevertheless seems desirable that this
revelation of the sacred books of India
should be authentic and that our knowledge,
still so slight, so unimportant, so
timid and so incoherent, should gradually
confirm, as indeed it unwittingly does daily,
certain points scattered through the boundless
immensity of this immemorial truth.</p>

<p>It would in any case, even if it did not
succeed in affecting us directly, possess the
advantage of enlarging our horizon, which
is narrower than we suppose, until it embraces
infinity; of studding this infinity with
magnificent landmarks; of animating it,
peopling it, filling it with wonderful faces,
making it a living, perceptible, almost
comprehensible thing.</p>

<p>We all know that we dwell in infinity;
but this infinity is, for us, only a bare and
barren word, a black and uninhabitable
void, a formless abstraction, a lifeless expression,
to which our imagination can give
only a momentary vitality, at the cost of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
tiring, solitary, unskilful, unassisted, ungrateful
and unfruitful effort. We hold
ourselves, in fact, pent in this terrestrial
world of ours and in our brief historic
ages; and at the most we raise our eyes,
from time to time, towards the other
planets of our solar system and project
our thoughts, which are discouraged from
the beginning, as far as the nebulous
periods that preceded man&#8217;s advent on our
globe. More and more deliberately we
are directing the whole activity of our intelligence
upon ourselves; and, by a regrettable
optical illusion, the more it restricts
its field of action, the deeper we believe it
to be probing. Our thinkers and philosophers,
fearing lest they should stray as
their predecessors did before them, no
longer concern themselves with any but
the least disputable aspects, problems and
secrets; but, if these are the least disputable,
they are also the least sublime;
and man, in his quality as a terrestrial animal,
becomes the sole object of their investigations.
The scientists, on the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
hand, are accumulating minor data and
observations whose weight is stifling them;
yet they no longer dare to thrust them
aside or open them out, so as to ventilate
them by some general law, some salutary
hypothesis, for those which they have
hitherto ventured to advance have been
pitiably contradicted, one after the other,
and scouted by experience.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they are right to act as
they do and to continue their investigations
according to their narrow and restricted
methods; but we are entitled to observe
that, the closer they believe that they have
drawn to a fugitive truth, the greater are
their uncertainty and confusion, the more
precarious, imaginary and insufficient seem
the foundations upon which they based
their confidence and the more fully do they
perceive the immense distance that still divides
them from the least of life&#8217;s secrets.
As one of the most illustrious of them, Sir
William Grove, prophetically remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The day is fast approaching when it
will be confessed that the Forces we know
are but the phenomenal manifestations of
Realities we know nothing about, but which
were known to the Ancients and by them
worshipped.&#8221;</p>
</div>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>This, indeed, is what we are bound to
think if we study slightly this primitive
revelation, this ancient wisdom and what
has grown out of it. Man once knew
more than he now knows. He was ignorant
perhaps of the enormous mass of petty
details which we have observed and classified
and which have enabled us to subdue
certain forces which he never thought of
turning to account: but it is probable that
he understood better than we do their nature,
their essence and their origin.</p>

<p>The higher civilization of humanity,
which history traces back tentatively to five
or six thousand years before Christ, is
perhaps far more ancient; and, without
admitting, as has been asserted, that
the Egyptians kept astronomical records
through a period of six hundred and thirty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
thousand years, we may consider it as established
that their observations embraced
two precessional cycles, two sidereal years,
or fifty-one thousand, seven hundred and
thirty-six solar years. Now they themselves
were not initiators but initiates, who
derived all that they knew from a more
ancient source. It was the same with the
Semites, in the matter of their primitive
books and their Kabbalah; and the Greeks,
among whom all those who really taught
us something about the origin and constitution
of the world and its elements, about
nature and divinity, mind and matter, men
such as Hesiod, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras,
Plato and the Neo-Platonists, were likewise
initiates, that is to say, they were men
who, having travelled in Egypt or India,
had drunk of the same one and immemorial
spring. Our prehistoric religions, Scandinavian
or Germanic and the Druidism of
the Celts, those of China and Japan, of
Mexico and Peru, despite numerous deformations,
were also derived from the
same source, even as our great western<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
metaphysics, which preceded our modern
materialism, with its somewhat sordid outlook,
and notably the metaphysics of Leibnitz,
Kant, Schelling, Fichte and Hegel
have approached it and, more or less unconsciously,
slaked their thirst at it.</p>

<p>It is therefore certain that through the
Greeks, through the Bible, through Christianity,
which is its last echo, for the author
of the Apocalypse and St. Paul were initiates,
we are all steeped in this revelation;
that there is not and never has been any
other; that it is the great human or superhuman
revelation; and that consequently it
would be right and salutary to study it
more attentively and more profoundly than
we have hitherto done.</p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>Where does the source of this revelation
lie? We place it in the east because nearly
everything that we know about it is found
in the sacred books of India. But it is
almost certainly of western or rather
Hyperborean origin and dates back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
those wonderful vanished Atlanteans,
whose last Protoscythian colonies flourished
over eleven thousand years ago and
whose existence can no longer be denied.</p>

<p>Remember that famous passage in
Plato:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;One day, when Solon was conversing
with the priests of Sa&iuml;s on the history of
the remote ages, one of them said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always
children!... There is not an opinion,
not a tradition of knowledge among
you that is old.... You know nothing
of that noble race of heroes of whom you
are a remnant.... Nine thousand years,
as our annals record, have elapsed since
what I am about to tell you.... The
most famous of your actions was the overthrow
of the island of Atlantis, which lay
over against the Pillars of Hercules, was
greater than Libya and Asia put together
and was the passage to other islands and
to a great ocean whereof the Mediterranean
Sea was but a harbour; and within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
the Pillars the empire of Atlantis reached
in Europe to Tyrrhenia and in Libya to
Egypt. This mighty power was arrayed
against Egypt and Greece and all the Mediterranean
countries. Then your city did
bravely and won renown throughout the
earth. For, risking her own existence, she
repelled the invader and gave liberty to
all the nations within the Pillars. Soon
after, earthquakes arose and floods; and
your warlike race was swallowed up by the
earth; and the island of Atlantis also disappeared
in the sea.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>This page in the <i>Tim&aelig;us</i> is the first
glimpse that history properly so-called affords
of the immense chaos of the antediluvian
period. Modern researches and
discoveries have confirmed it step by step.
To quote Roisel, who devoted a remarkable
book to the Atlanteans, a work less
well-known than those of Scott Elliott and
Rudolf Steiner, but one that does not admit
of the slightest doubt:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;It is proved that, long before the historic
ages, the Atlanticans had acquired a
marvellous science whose elements mankind
is hardly beginning to reconstitute
and whose mighty relics are found in ancient
Gaul, Egypt, Persia, India and the
central portion of the American continent.
More than ten thousand years before our
era, they knew the precession of the equinoxes,
the slow changes which many stars
experience in their courses and the thousand
secrets of nature. They had processes
of which modern industry has not
yet fathomed the mysteries.&#8221;</p>
</div>


<h3>9</h3>

<p>The outcome of these studies is that
humanity never underwent a disaster to be
compared with the disappearance of Atlantis.
It will perhaps need thousands of
years to repair that loss and to reascend
to the level of a civilization which had certainties
of which we laboriously glean the
scattered remnants, regarding the origin
and movements of the universe, the energy
of matter, the unknown forces of this and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
other worlds, the life beyond the grave and
a social organization and political economy
similar to those of the bees. Nothing
could better prove the uselessness of man&#8217;s
effort than this unparalleled loss, if we did
not strive to hope in spite of all.</p>

<p>A nation of wonderful metallurgists,
who had discovered the means of tempering
copper for which we are still seeking, a
nation of fabulous engineers, whose geometry,
as Professor Smyth tells us, began
where Euclid&#8217;s ends, they lifted and transported
to enormous distances, by mysterious
methods, rocks weighing fifteen hundred
tons and strewed the world with
those fantastic moving stones known as
&#8220;mad stones&#8221; and &#8220;stones of truth,&#8221;
stones weighing five hundred tons and so
ingeniously poised on one of their corners
that a child can move them with its finger,
whereas the united impetus of two hundred
men would be incapable of overturning
them, stones which, from the geological
point of view, never belong to the spot
where they are found. A nation of explorers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
who had traversed and colonized
the whole surface of the earth, a nation of
scholars, mathematicians and astronomers,
they appear to have been above all things
ruthless rationalists and logicians, endowed
with, so to speak, a metallic brain,
the lateral lobes of which were much more
highly developed than ours. They applied
their incomparable faculties exclusively
to the study of the exact sciences;
and the sole object of their energies was
the conquest of truth. But the study of
the invisible and the infinite, under their
powerful scrutiny, itself becomes an exact
science; and the main idea of their cosmogony,
by virtue of which everything
issues from the ocean of cosmic matter or
from the boundless waves of the eternal
ether, soon to return and to reemerge,
disfigured and overladen with numberless
myths by the imagination of their degenerate
descendants or settlers: this main
idea forms the base of every religion. It
is improbable that man will ever discover
one to equal it or replace it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span></p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>It is in the sacred books of India that
we find the surest and most plentiful traces
of this cosmogony or of this revelation.
Less than a century ago, men were almost
wholly unaware of the existence of
these sacred books. Their interpreters
have taken two different paths. On the
one hand, scholars whom we may describe
as official have supplied translations of a
certain number of texts, which might also
be called official, texts which they do not
always understand and which their readers
understand even less. On the other hand,
initiates, genuine or pretended, with the
assistance of adepts of an occult fraternity,
have suggested a new and more impressive
interpretation of these same texts or of
others still more secret. They still,
rightly or wrongly, inspire a certain distrust.
We are obliged to admit the authenticity
and the antiquity of certain traditions,
of certain primitive and essential
writings, though it is impossible to assign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
an approximate date to them, so completely
are they merged in the mists of the prehistoric
ages. But they are almost incomprehensible
without keys and commentaries;
and it is here that our doubts and
hesitations begin. A large number of
those commentaries are likewise very ancient
and in their turn need keys; others
appear to be more recent; lastly, others
seem to be contemporary; and it is often
difficult to draw a dividing line between
that which may well exist in the original
and that which the interpreters believe to
exist in the original or which they more or
less deliberately add to it. Now the most
striking, the most impressive and in any
case the most lucid part of the doctrine is
often contained in the commentaries.</p>

<p>Next, as I have observed, comes the
question of the keys, which is intimately
connected with the foregoing. These
keys are more or less workable and command
more or less respect; sometimes they
seem fanciful or arbitrary; they are delivered
only with curious precautions, singly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
and grudgingly; and they are apt to
unlock several superimposed meanings.
And all this is accompanied by fantastic
reticences, by so-called dangerous or terrible
secrets, withheld at the decisive moment,
and by revelations which, it is contended,
cannot be communicated until many
centuries have elapsed. Doors through
which we were about to pass are slammed
in our faces just as we were at last catching
a glimpse of a long-promised horizon; and
behind each of them hides a supreme initiate,
a still living master, the sacred guardian
of the ultimate mysteries, who knows
all things, but can or will say nothing.</p>

<p>Observe, moreover, that a host of more
or less intelligent <i>illuminati</i>, of elderly
women and unbalanced spinsters, of simple-minded
people who accept, blindly and
off-hand, that which they do not understand,
of discontented, unsuccessful, vain
or crafty persons who fish in troubled waters,
in a word, all the usual suspect mob
that gathers round any more or less mysterious
doctrine, science or phenomenon, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
discredited these first esoteric interpretations,
of which the very source is none too
dear. Lastly, let us add that the burning
of the famous library of Alexandria, in
which all the knowledge of the east was
amassed, the destruction in the sixteenth
century, under the Mogul Akbar, of thousands
of Sanskrit volumes, the systematic
and merciless demolition, especially during
the first few centuries of the Church and in
the Middle Ages, of all that referred or
alluded to this dreaded and embarrassing
revelation, have deprived us of our best
means of control. The adepts, it is true,
assert on the other hand that the true texts,
as well as the ancient commentaries which
alone enable them to be understood, still
exist in the secret crypts and subterranean
libraries of Thibet or the Himalayas, libraries
of books more innumerable than
any which we possess in the west, and that
they will reappear in a more enlightened
age. It is possible, but in the meanwhile
they are of no help to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span></p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>Be this as it may, what we have is
enough to perplex us greatly; and the control
allowed by the fragments which have
been saved from historic antiquity absolutely
removes all suspicion of more or less
recent fraud or deception in respect of the
essentials. Moreover, any fraud or deception
of this nature seems hardly possible
and would be so ingenious that we
should be obliged to marvel at it as a phenomenon
almost as remarkable as that
whereof it would be seeking to give the
illusion; and we should have to admit that
the mind of man has never insinuated itself
so far into the infinity of time and space,
or into the origin of things, and has never
risen to such heights. Had this revelation
profited by all the attainments of our latter-day
science and thought, it could not
have furnished us with theories more satisfactory,
more logical, more coherent,
more plausible, more synthetic, or worthier
of the infinity which they strive to embrace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
and often seem to attain, on the rhythm of
the eternities, the ebb and flow of the eternal
Becoming, the never-ending cycle and
the periodic existences of the ego, the birth,
movement and evolution of the worlds, the
divine breath and the intelligence that animate
it, on Maya, the eternal illusion of
ignorance, the struggle for life, natural
selection, the gradual development and
transformation of stars and men, the functions
and energies of the ether, immortal
and infallible justice, the intermolecular
and fantastic activity of matter, on the nature
of the soul and the existence of the
vast, nameless power that governs the universe,
in a word, on all the riddles that
assail and all the mysteries that overwhelm
us.</p>

<p>But, let us hasten to repeat it, there could
not seriously be any question of fraud, because
the texts or traditions that might be
regarded with suspicion are corroborated
by other texts, such as the sacred inscriptions
of Egypt, which no one thinks of contesting.
At most we may come upon a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
few passages antedated by the imprudent
zeal of adepts or commentators, a few interpolations
which merely embroider the
majestic lines. Taking it as a whole, we
have to do with a revelation which dates
back infinitely farther than all that we have
called the prehistoric ages, wherefore it is
legitimate that our astonishment should be
unbounded.</p>


<h3>12</h3>

<p>Very good, it will be said, this interpretation
of the universe, this anthropocosmogenesis
is the loftiest, the most spacious,
the most wonderful, the most unassailable
that has ever been conceived; it teems in
every part with human thought and imagination;
but what is it all based upon?
When all is said, we have here only magnificent
hypotheses, boldly disguised as authoritative,
dogmatic and peremptory declarations,
but every one incapable of verification.
This is the objection which I
myself put forward, a little hastily, in one
of the early chapters of <i>Our Eternity</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>It is indeed undeniable that we shall not
for some time to come, that perhaps we
shall never know the truth about the origin
and the end of the universe or any of the
other problems which these declarations
profess to solve. But it is curious to note
that science, despite itself, is daily drawing
nearer to one or other of these declarations
and that it is unable to set aside or to
contradict any of them. There is for example,
a certain study of the genesis of
the elements, by the well-known chemist,
Sir William Crookes, which unconsciously
becomes plainly occultist, while the discovery
of the radioactivity of matter reproduces
precisely the theory of vortices of
the initiate Anaxagoras. It is the same,
<i>mutatis mutandis</i>, with the function attributed
to the ether, the latest, indispensable
postulate of our scientists. It is the same
with the supreme and essential functions of
certain minute glands of which modern
medicine is only now beginning to rediscover
the importance and which probably
hold hidden the primordial secrets of life:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
the thyroid gland, which directs growth
and intelligence; the suprarenal gland,
which governs the unconscious muscle that
is the heart; and the pineal gland, the most
mysterious of all, which brings us into relation
with the unknown worlds. It is
the same again with astronomy, when the
manifest insufficiency of our so-called cosmic
laws, notably that of gravitation, propounds
a host of questions which only the
cosmogony of the east is able to answer.
But this would require a long enquiry,
which I am not qualified to undertake.</p>

<p>For the rest, nothing obliges us to accept
these declarations as dogmas. There
is no question here of a religion which imposes
upon us its blind faith, its <i>Credo
quia absurdum</i>. We are quite entitled to
regard them as mere hypotheses, as immense,
incomparable antediluvian poems,
of which the Mosaic Genesis is but a disfigured
fragment. But, even as hypotheses
or poems, it must be admitted that they
are prodigious, that we have nothing better,
nothing more probable to set against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
them and that, in view of their incontestable
antiquity, of their prehistoric origin,
they seem really superhuman.</p>

<p>Must we admit, as the occultists contend,
that they come to us from beings superior
to man, from more spiritual entities,
living under unknown conditions, who occupied
our earth or the neighbouring planets
before our coming; from a Lemuro-Atlantean
civilization which, in its megalithic
monuments, has left indelible traces
in the memory of the peoples and on the
face of our earth? It is quite possible;
but here again we are free to await the
confirmations of Hindu, Egyptian, Chaldean,
Assyrian and Persian arch&aelig;ology,
which on this point, as on so many others,
has not spoken its last word.</p>


<h3>13</h3>

<p>I am well aware that this revelation, as
apparently all those which may be made
in the course of time, dates back to and
ends in the unknowable, the insoluble mystery
of divinity, of being, or existence; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
it necessarily stops short before the barrier
of this unknowable, which is as impenetrable
and impregnable as a cliff that
is infinite in every dimension and formed
of a single block of black diamond. There
is nothing to be done; we can but halt; we
cannot even seek to outflank it, to approach
it from the other side, for the other side,
if we could reach it, would necessarily be
like the side in front of us, seeing that the
non-existence of everything would be just
as inexplicable, just as incomprehensible as
its existence. It is true that, in the secret
recesses of the doctrine, the universe and
all that it contains is known as Maya, that
is to say, the eternal illusion, so that the
two irreconcilable mysteries unite in a still
greater mystery which man&#8217;s intelligence
can no longer approach.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, the primitive riddle, the
primordial mystery not being elucidated,
all the rest illumines only the steps that
lead from comparative knowledge to absolute
ignorance. It will probably be the
same with all the revelations that may address<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
themselves to man&#8217;s intelligence so
long as he continues on this planet, for
this intelligence doubtless has limits which
no effort can enlarge. But in the meantime
it is certain that these steps, which
lead to nothing, nevertheless, at the first
onset and from the earliest days led him
to the highest point which his intelligence
has attained or can hope to attain. The
most ancient explanation embraces straightway
all the attempts at explanation that
have hitherto been offered. It harmonizes
the positivism of science with the
most transcendental idealism; it accepts
matter and spirit; it reconciles the mechanical
impulsion of atoms and worlds
with their intelligent guidance. It gives
us an unconditioned divinity, &#8220;a causeless
cause of all the causes,&#8221; worthy of the universe
which is this divinity itself and of
which all the divinities that have succeeded
it in all our religions are but scattered,
mutilated and unrecognizable members.
It offers us, lastly, in its law of Karma, by
virtue of which each being undergoes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
his successive lives the consequences of his
actions and gradually purifies himself, the
loftiest, justest and most unassailable, the
most fertile, consoling and hopeful moral
principle that could ever be proposed to
man. Because of all this it appears worthy
of investigation, respect and admiration.</p>


<h3>14</h3>

<p>This respect and admiration, however,
do not militate against our liberty to
choose or reject many things, or to reserve
them while we wait for further light.
When we are told, for instance, that the
Cosmos is guided by an infinite series of
hierarchies of sensient beings, each having
a mission to fulfil, which are the agents of
the Karmic and Cosmic laws; when it is
added that each of these beings was a man
in an earlier Manvantara, or is preparing
to become one in the present or in a future
Manvantara, that they are perfected men,
or nascent men, and that, in their higher
and less material spheres, they do not differ
morally from terrestrial human beings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
save in that they do not possess the sense
of personality and of emotional nature;
when, lastly, we are assured that what we
call unconscious Nature is in reality a complex
of forces manipulated by semi-intelligent
beings (Elementals) directed by the
High Planetary Spirits (Dhyani-Shohans),
whose total forms the Word Manifest of
the non-manifest Logos and constitutes at
the same time both the intelligence of the
universe and its immutable law, we can do
homage to the ingenuity of these speculations,
as to that of thousands of others
which perhaps embrace the truth more
closely than our best and most recent scientific
hypotheses; we are free to take
what we please from them and to leave
what we please. All this, I grant, is by no
means proved, is not verified, or cannot be
verified, save in certain details, whereas
the great fundamental outlines will probably
always escape the control of our
unequipped intelligence. But what we
must, I repeat, admire without reserve is
the prodigious spiritual edifice offered by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
the sum total of this revelation, the immense
intellectual effort which, since the
dawn of humanity, has attempted to unravel
the unfathomable chaos of the origin,
structure, progress, direction and end
of the universe and which appears to have
succeeded to this extent, that hitherto nothing
has been found that equals it, or is
not inspired by it or, often unconsciously,
returns to it.</p>


<h3>15</h3>

<p>I said in the first part of this essay that
too lofty a revelation, even were it incontestable,
would have hardly any influence
upon our life, that it would change little
in it, that it would occur too far from us
in the immensity of space and that it would
not sink into our hearts and minds. Was
it thus with that of which we are now
speaking, which is the only truly superhuman
and yet acceptable and almost unassailable
revelation that we have had?
Yes and no, according to the point of view
which we take up. All that it contains of
too great a character, except its notion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
eternity, has not really modified our ideas,
has not permeated into our habits. It has
not even profoundly affected the peoples
who have handed it down to us and who,
abandoning any endeavour to understand
it, have transformed it into a barbarous
and monstrous anthropomorphic polytheism.
It is more or less the same everywhere.
All the religions, from the pagan
religions of China and Japan, Gaul and
ancient Germany, Mexico and Peru, down
to Christianity with its variants and its offshoots,
have issued from it; but all have
not been able to live and govern men, save
by disfiguring and mutilating it, by dwarfing
it to the lowest stature of the souls
of their time, by altering it beyond recognition.
It is therefore highly probable
that matters would be the same with any
other and greater revelation, if such were
possible, even though this had all the signs
of a divine, direct, authentic, indubitable,
irrefutable, irrecusable revelation, in a
word, with that which we are still awaiting
without daring to hope for it.</p>

<small>THE NECESSARY SILENCE</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE practitioners of occult science in
the east tell us of certain dwellers
in the solitudes of Thibet and the Himalayas,
Initiates, Masters, heirs to the wisdom
of the &#8220;Sons of Light,&#8221; or the
&#8220;Seven Primordials,&#8221; who possess the
seven keys which enable them to understand
the sacred prehistoric texts. They
are said to be the silent depositories of the
secret of the intermolecular or interetheric
forces, by the aid of which the races
of beings who preceded man upon this
earth used to transport to enormous distances
monoliths of more than five hundred
tons&#8217; weight, which have no relation to the
stones that surround them and whose arrangement
and astronomical orientation
manifestly reveal the intervention of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
intelligent and even a highly scientific mind.</p>

<p>These monoliths are sometimes carved,
as for instance the famous colossal idols
in the valley of Bamian, in Afghanistan,
of which one is 173 feet high, or the five
hundred and fifty monsters of Easter Island,
in Polynesia, which, we may observe
in passing, remain one of the most insoluble
and perplexing riddles in the world.
Hewn out of basalt, reclining or standing
erect upon their platforms, these sculptures,
one of which measures over 90 feet
in height, are undoubtedly the most ancient
human effigies to be found upon our
earth. Official science ascribes to them
an antediluvian origin, while esoteric tradition
regards them as portraits of the
giants of the last Atlantean race, which
became degenerate and lapsed into witchcraft
shortly before the disappearance of
the mysterious continent whereof Easter
Island is supposed to be merely one of the
loftier summits to-day emerging from the
lonely Pacific.</p>

<p>I have before me as I write the photographs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
of some of these haunting giants;
and I do not believe that in our most oppressive
nightmares it would be possible
to imagine faces more formidable, more
impassive and unfeeling, more eternally
ferocious, more coldly supercilious, more
pitilessly disdainful and icily omnipotent.
Are they Selenites or Martians, with their
tightly-closed, implacable mouths and
those eyes of theirs, hollow, like wells of
malediction, or protuberant and framed
in an airman&#8217;s goggles? They are not
in any way simian, as one might have supposed,
but rather represent demoniacal
and abstract entities, such as evil, doom
and fatality. They seem not so much inhuman
as prehuman or posthuman; and
they bear a horrible relation to certain ancestral
memories which slumber in the
marrow of our bones, warning us that
such faces undoubtedly once existed.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>But let us return to our great Initiates.
They are, it appears, reputed to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
guardians of the irresistible and incommensurable
sidereal force, the force which
supports and directs the worlds and which
is capable, if it were misused, of destroying
in a moment the whole human species,
all that lives upon the earth and this very
earth itself; but it is also capable, if it were
wisely tamed, of ensuring man an ultimate
royalty, perhaps access to other heavenly
bodies and, in any case, a power so great
that the Golden Age which existed of old,
thanks to the subjection of this force,
might flourish once more upon our planet.</p>

<p>All this is possible; and, for the moment,
we need not go into the matter.
But that, possessing the secret of this force
and of many others, transmitted from
Hierophant to Candidate, or, as they say
&#8220;from mouth to ear,&#8221; the experts in occult
science do not divulge it and place it at the
service of humanity: this is the great reproach
brought against them; and for all
those who are not aware that the end of
Initiation is not power and material happiness
but wisdom, development and the uplifting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
of the inner being it is the best
proof that they are cheats and impostors.
It may be that, driven into a corner, they
are silent because they have nothing to
tell us; but the argument is not so unanswerable
as those who avail themselves
of it are inclined to think. We shall perhaps
see this before long. It is indeed not
impossible that one day some accident of
knowledge will place one or other of our
scientists in a position analogous to that
of these Masters or Initiates. To him
also the terrible question of the necessary
silence will then present itself. We have
but lately witnessed in this war the insensate
and demoniacal use which man has
made of certain inventions. What will
happen if other energies are placed in his
hands, energies far more formidable,
which we seem to be on the point of discovering
and releasing?</p>

<p>Man is not ready to know more of such
matters than he now knows. The safety
of the species is at stake. Humanity,
which is hardly emerging from its infancy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
or has only just attained the dangerous
period of adolescence (it would be about
sixteen or seventeen years of age, according
to Dr. Jaworski&#8217;s well-supported and
striking historic parallel), has already
passed the limit of the inventions which
it is able to assimilate or endure without
incurring the risk of death. Almost all
of them, from the subjection of steam and
the still dubious taming of electricity, have
done it incomparably more harm than
good. Explosives, for example, which
have helped it to build a few roads&mdash;a
work which the Romans, for that matter,
did quite as well as we do&mdash;to open up
a few mines, to pierce a few tunnels, have
cost it millions of young lives.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is time, not to check the investigations
of science, but to control its
discoveries and to reserve, as the occultists
wisely did, for a select circle of Initiates,
rigorously tested and bound by inviolable
oaths, the secret of those too perilous energies
around which we are feeling our way
and which are on the point of revealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
themselves and becoming public property.
Our moral evolution is several centuries
behind our scientific evolution; and it is
more than probable that the latter, being
too swift and too intensive, may disastrously
impede the former. It will profit
no one to travel in three hours from Paris
to Pekin, from Pekin to New York and
from New York to Calcutta, if these repeated
and miraculous journeys leave those
who take them in the same frame of mind
on their arrival as on their departure.
We are more or less in the same position as
Russia, whose heart and spirit were not
steadfast enough, not resolute enough, to
bear what the head had too quickly and
too artificially stored up. Nothing is
more quickly disseminated or more readily
assimilated than the results of science; nothing,
on the other hand, is more slow,
more painful or more precarious than
moral evolution; and yet it is upon this
alone, as we are realizing more and more
clearly, that man&#8217;s happiness and future
depend.</p>

<small>KARMA</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">STRIPPED of its innumerable and
inextricable oriental complications,
which may possibly correspond with realities
but which cannot be verified, Karma,
the infallible Law of Retribution, is, when
all is said, what we, speaking more vaguely
and without believing in it unduly, call
Immanent Justice. Our Immanent Justice
is a somewhat idle shadow. True, it
often manifests itself after monstrous actions,
great vices, sins or iniquities; but we
rarely have the opportunity of seeing it
intervene in the thousand petty acts of injustice,
cruelty, weakness, dishonesty and
baseness of ordinary life, though the aggregate
of these paltry but incessant misdeeds
may weigh heavier than the most
notorious crime. In any case, its action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
being more dispersed, more diffuse, slower
and more often moral than material, nearly
always escapes our observation; and, as, on
the other hand, it appears to cease at the
moment of death, it hardly ever has time
to demand its due and usually arrives too
late at the bedside of a sick or dying man,
who has lost consciousness or no longer
has the time to expiate his offences.</p>

<p>Karma then, if you will, is Immanent
Justice; only, it is no longer an inconstant
goddess, inconsistent, incoherent, impotent,
erratic, capricious, inexact, forgetful, timid,
inattentive, sluggish, evasive, intangible
and bounded by the tomb, but a god, vast
and inevitable as Destiny, a god who fills
up each outlet, each horizon, each crevice
of every existence and who is omnipresent,
omniscient, omnipotent, infallible, impassible
and incorruptible. He is in us, as
we are in him. He is ourselves. He is
more than we: he is what we are, while he
is still what we were and is already what
we shall become. We are small, evanescent
and ephemeral; he is great, imperturbable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
immovable, eternal. Nothing
escapes him of that which escapes us and
no doubt will escape us even beyond the
tomb. Not an action, not a wish, not a
thought, not the shadow of an intention
but is weighed more strictly than it was
weighed by the forty-two posthumous
judges who awaited the soul on that further
shore of which we are told in one of
the most ancient texts in the world, the
Egyptian <i>Book of the Dead</i>. All is set
down, dated, valued, verified, classified,
entered as debit or credit, as reward or
expiation, in the immense and eternal index
of the astral records. There can be nothing
that he does not know, because he has
taken part in all that he judges; and he
judges us not from the depth of our present
ignorance, but from the height of all
that we shall learn much later. He is not
only our intelligence and our consciousness
of to-day, which are hardly waking and
no longer count their errors; he is even
now, for they already dwell within us,
though they be inactive, impotent, dumb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
and blind, our intelligence and our consciousness
to come, when they shall have
attained, in the course of the ages and of
the innumerable developments, expiations
and ascents, the loftiest summits of Wisdom
and Discernment.</p>

<p>At the hour of our death the account
seems closed; but he is simply asleep and
will resume his hold of us again. He will
slumber perhaps for hundreds, nay, thousands
of years in &#8220;Devachan,&#8221; that is to
say, in the state of unconsciousness which
prepares us for a new incarnation; but,
when we awake, we shall find the assets
and liabilities added up beyond recall; and
our Karma will merely continue the life
which we have laid aside. It will continue
to be ourselves in that life and to see the
consequences of our faults and our deserts
burst into flower and afterwards to see
other causes bear fruit in other effects,
until the consummation of the ages when
every thought born upon this earth ends by
losing sight of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span></p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Karma, as we see, is, when all is said,
the immortal entity which man fashions by
his deeds and thoughts and which follows
him, or rather envelops and absorbs him,
through his successive lives and changes,
even as he incessantly changes, while preserving
every previous impress. Man&#8217;s
thoughts, as this doctrine very truly says,
build up his character; his deeds make his
environment. What man has thought,
that he has become; his qualities and natural
gifts adhere to him as the results of
his ideas. He is, in all truth, created by
himself. He is in the fullest sense of the
word responsible for all that he is. He
is contained in the net of all that he has
done. He can neither undo nor destroy
the past; but, so long as the effects of the
past are yet to come, it is possible for him
to alter them or to divert them by fresh
exertions. Nothing can affect him that he
has not set in movement; no evil can befall
him that he has not deserved. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
infinite evolution of the eternities he will
never find himself in the presence of any
judge other than himself.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>It is certain that the idea of this supreme
judge, who is our consciousness uninterrupted
throughout the centuries and
the millenaries, who is each one of us
grown more and more enlightened, more
and more incorruptible and infallible, leads
to the highest, sincerest and purest system
of morals that it is possible to conceive or
to justify here below. The judge and the
defendant are no longer face to face; they
are one within the other and form but one
and the same person. They can hide nothing
from each other; and both have the
same urgent interest in discovering the
least fault, the slightest shadow and in
purifying themselves as quickly and as
completely as possible, in order to put an
end to the reincarnations and to live at last
in the One Being. The best, the saintliest
are near doing so from the moment when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
they quit this life; but, detached from all
things, they do not cease to act for the good
of all men, for already they know all
things. They go farther than the mystic
Christian who expects a reward from without:
they are their own reward. They go
farther than Marcus Aurelius, the great
type of the man without illusions, who continues
to act without hoping that his action
can profit others: they know that nothing
is useless, that nothing can be wasted; it
is when they no longer need anything whatever
that they work with the greatest ardour.</p>

<p>Contrary to what is too generally believed,
this system of morals which leads
to absolute repose extols activity. Hear,
in this connection, the great teachings of
the <i>Bhagavad-Gita</i>, the Lord&#8217;s Song, which
is perhaps, as its translators, not without
good reason, think, the most beautiful, that
is to say, the most exalted book known up
to the present time:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Thy business is with the action only,
never with its fruits; so let not the fruit
of action be thy motive.... Perform
action ... dwelling in union with the divine,
renouncing attachments and balanced
evenly in success and failure.... Pitiable
are they who work for fruit....
Man winneth not freedom from action by
abstaining from activity, nor by mere renunciation
doth he rise to perfection....
Perform thou right action, for action is
superior to inaction; and, inactive, even
the maintenance of thy body would not be
possible. The world is bound by action,
unless performed for the sake of sacrifice....</p>

<p>&#8220;He who seeth inaction in action and
action in inaction, he is wise among men,
he is harmonious, even while performing
all action. Whose works are all free from
the moulding of desire, whose actions are
burned up by the fire of wisdom, him the
wise have called a sage. Having abandoned
attachment to the fruit of action, always
content, nowhere seeking refuge, he
is not doing anything, although doing actions....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
He should be known as a perpetual
ascetic, who neither hateth nor desireth;
free from the pairs of opposites
... he is easily set free from bondage....&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>And remember that this, which forms
part of the <i>Mahabharata</i>, the greatest epic
on earth, was written four or five thousand
years ago.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>Whatever we may think of the plausibility
of the doctrine or revelation, we
cannot dispute that this morality and this
justification of justice are the most ancient
and at the same time the most beautiful
and reassuring that the mind of man has
imagined. But they are based upon a postulate
which we are perhaps too much inclined
to refuse blindly. It asks us in fact
to admit that our existence does not end
at the hour of our death and that the
spirit, or the vital spark, which does not
perish, seeks an asylum and reappears in
other bodies. At first the postulate seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
monstrous and unacceptable; but on closer
examination its aspect becomes much less
strange, less arbitrary and less unreasonable.
It is, to begin with, certain that, if
all things undergo transformation, nothing
perishes or is annihilated in a universe
which knows no nothingness and in which
nothingness alone remains absolutely inconceivable.
What we call nothingness
could therefore be only another mode of
existence, of persistence and of life; and,
if we cannot admit that the body, which is
only matter, is annihilated in its substance,
it is no less difficult to admit that, if it were
animated by a spirit&mdash;which it is hardly
possible to dispute&mdash;this spirit should disappear
without leaving a trace of any kind.</p>

<p>So the first point of the postulate and the
most important is of necessity granted.
There remains the second point, that of the
successive reincarnations. Here, it is true,
we have only hypotheses and probabilities.
It is necessary that this spirit, this soul,
this vital spark or principle, this idea, this
immaterial substance&mdash;it matters little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
what name we give it&mdash;must go or reside
somewhere, must do or become something.
It may wander in the infinity of space and
time, dissolve, lose itself and disappear, or
at least mingle and become confused with
what it encounters there, and finally become
absorbed in that boundless spiritual
or vital energy which appears to animate
the universe. But, of all hypotheses, the
least probable is not that which tells us
that, on leaving a body which has become
uninhabitable, instead of escaping and wandering
through the illimitable vast that fills
it with terror, it looks about it for a lodging
resembling that which it has lately
quitted. Obviously this is only an hypothesis;
but in our complete and terrible ignorance
it presents itself before any other.
We have nothing to support it save the
most ancient tradition of humanity, a tradition
perhaps prehuman and in any case
absolutely general; and experience tends
to show that at the base of these traditions
and these instances of universal assent
there is nearly always a great truth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
that they must be accorded a greater importance
and a greater value than have
hitherto been attributed to them.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>As regards evidence, or rather premonitory
suggestions of evidence, we have
scarcely anything beyond the experiments
of Colonel de Rochas, who, by means of
hypnotic passes, succeeded in making a few
exceptional mediums retrace not only the
whole course of their present lives, back to
their earliest childhood, but also that of
a certain number of previous existences.
It cannot be denied that these extremely
serious experiments, which were very scientifically
conducted, are most bewildering;
but the danger of unconscious suggestion
or telepathy is not and doubtless
will never be sufficiently remote to allow
them to become really conclusive.</p>

<p>We find further, on pursuing the same
train of ideas, certain cases of reincarnation,
like that of one of Dr. Samson&#8217;s little
daughters, as related in the <i>Annales des<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
sciences psychiques</i> for July, 1913. This
case, which is almost undisputed, is exceedingly
curious; but, though it is not
unique, those which resemble it are too
rare to allow us to rely upon them.</p>

<p>There remains what are known as prenatal
reminiscences. It happens fairly
often that a man who finds himself in an
unfamiliar country, in a city, a palace, a
church, a house, or a garden, which he is
visiting for the first time, is conscious of
a strange and very definite impression that
he &#8220;has seen it before.&#8221; It suddenly
seems to him that this landscape, these
vaulted ceilings, these rooms and the very
furniture and pictures which he finds in
them are quite well-known to him and that
he recollects every nook and corner and
every detail. Which of us but has, at least
once in his life, vaguely experienced some
such impression? But the recollections
are often so definite that the person in
whom they occur is able to act as a guide
through the house or park which he has
never explored and to describe beforehand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
what his party will find in this or that room
or at the turn of this or that avenue. Is
it really a recollection of previous existences,
a telepathic phenomenon or an ancestral
and hereditary memory? The
same question suggests itself touching certain
innate aptitudes or faculties, by virtue
of which we see children of genius, musicians,
painters, mathematicians or simple
artisans, who know from the outset, without
learning them, nearly all the secrets of
their art or craft. Who will venture to
decide?</p>

<p>This is about all that we can cite in favour
of the doctrine of reincarnation. It
is not enough to weigh down the scales.
But all the other suppositions, theories or
religions, excepting spiritualism, which for
the rest is perfectly consistent with successive
existences, have less solid foundations
and are even, to be truthful, devoid of any.
It would therefore be ungracious on their
part to reproach the supposition which we
are considering with the instability of the
arguments whereon it is based.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>Once again, how desirable it would be
that all this were true! There would be
no more moral uncertainties, no more uneasiness
in respect of justice. And it is so
beautiful, so complete, that it is perhaps
real. It is difficult indeed to admit that
such a dream is untrue from first to last,
a dream which has been dreamed so long,
since the beginning of the world, by so
many thousands of millions of men and
which, despite numerous and far-reaching
distortions, has, when all is said, been the
one dream of humanity. It is not possible
to prove that it is based upon truth; but,
unlike most of the religions derived from
it, it is not possible either to demonstrate
that it is imaginary and fabricated throughout;
and, there being this doubt, why
should not reason, which it never offends,
be allowed to accept it and at heart to
hope and act as though it were true, while
waiting for science to confirm it completely,
or to invalidate it, or to give us another
hypothesis which it will perhaps never be
able to elaborate?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>What at first repels many of those who
investigate it is the unduly assured and
arbitrary insistence upon a thousand petty
details, probably interpolated, as in all religions,
by inferior minds, animated by a
narrow and maladroit zeal. But these details,
viewed from a certain elevation, do
not in any way alter the great outlines,
which remain immeasurable, admirable
and unspoiled.</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>For the rest, whether reincarnation be
accepted or rejected, there is surely such
a thing as survival, since death and nothingness
cannot be conceived; and the
whole matter is once more reduced to the
problem of continued identity. Even in
reincarnation this identity, from our present,
limited point of view, would possess
only a relative interest, seeing that, all memory
of previous existences being abolished,
it would necessarily evade us. Let
us ask ourselves, moreover, whether this
question of personality without solution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
continuity does really possess the importance
which we attach to it and whether this
importance is not a delusion, a temporary
blindness of our egoism, of our terrestrial
intelligence. For the fact remains that we
interrupt it and lose it every night without
disquieting ourselves. It is enough for us
to be certain that we shall recover it on
awaking; and we are reassured. But suppose
that this were not the case and that
one evening we were warned that we
should not recover it, that on the following
morning we should have forgotten all our
past existence and should begin a new life,
without any memory to connect us with the
old. Should we feel the same terror, the
same despair, as if we had been told that
we should never wake again and that we
should be hurled into our death? I do
not believe it, I even think that we should
accept our lot fairly cheerfully. It would
not greatly matter to us that we should
have to lose the memory of a past, consisting,
like the past of all of us, of more
evil than good, provided that life continued.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
It would no longer be our life, it
would no longer have anything in common
with the life of the day before; nevertheless
we should not believe that we were losing
it and we should retain a vague hope
of recovering or recognizing something of
ourselves in the existence before us. We
should take pains to prepare for this existence,
to insure it against misfortune and
distress, to make it, in advance, as pleasant
and as happy as possible. It might and
ought to be so, not only if we believe in reincarnation,
because the case would be almost
identical, but also if we do not believe
in it, since a survival of some sort is
almost certain and absolute annihilation
is actually inconceivable.</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>Perhaps with a little courage and goodwill
it would be possible for us, even in
this life, to look higher and farther, to
shed for an instant that narrow and dismal
egoism which refers all things to self, to
tell ourselves that the intelligence or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
good which our thoughts and efforts diffuse
in the spiritual spheres are not wholly
lost, even when it is not certain that the
little nucleus of trivial habits and commonplace
recollections that we are possesses
them exclusively. If the good actions
which we have performed, the noble or
merely honest intentions or thoughts which
we have experienced attach themselves and
give value to a life in which we shall not
recognize our own, this is not a sufficient
reason to regard them as useless or to deny
them all merit. It is well to remind ourselves
at times that we are nothing if we
are not everything and to learn from now
onwards to interest ourselves in something
that is not solely ourselves and already to
live the ampler, less personal, less egotistical
life which presently, without any doubt,
whatever may be our creed, will be our
eternal life, the only life that matters and
the only life for which it is wise to prepare
ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span></p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>If we do not accept reincarnation,
Karma none the less exists: a mutilated
Karma, it is true; a diminished Karma, devoid
of spaciousness, with an horizon limited
by death, beginning its work and doing
its best in the brief spell of time which it
has before it, but less negligible, less impotent,
less inactive and ineffective than is
supposed. Acting within its narrow
sphere, it gives us a fairly accurate albeit
very incomplete idea of what it would accomplish
in the wider sphere which we
deny it. But this would lead us back to
the highly debatable question of mundane
justice. It is almost insoluble, because its
decisive operations, being inward and
secret, escape observation. Following
many others, who, for the rest, have explained
it better than I, I have spoken of it
elsewhere, particularly in <i>Wisdom and
Destiny</i> and in <i>The Mystery of Justice</i>;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
but, as Queen Scheherazade might say, it
would serve no useful purpose to repeat it.</p>




<h3>9</h3>

<p>Let us then return to Karma properly
so-called, the ideal Karma. It rewards
goodness and punishes evil in the infinite
sequence of our lives. But first of all,
some will ask, what is this goodness, what
is this evil, what is the best or the worst of
our petty thoughts, our petty intentions,
our petty ephemeral actions, compared
with the boundless immensity of time and
space? Is there not an absurd disproportion
between the hugeness of the reward or
punishment and the pettiness of the fault
or merit? Why mix the worlds, the eternities
and the gods with things which,
however monstrous or admirable at first,
are not slow, even within the trivial limits
of our life, to lose gradually all the importance
which we ascribed to them, to
vanish, to fade into oblivion? That is true;
but we must needs speak of human things
in terms of human beings and on the human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
scale. What we call good or evil is that
which works us good or evil, that which
benefits or harms ourselves or others; and,
so long as we live upon this earth and have
not disappeared, we must needs attach to
good and evil an importance which in
themselves they do not possess. The noblest
religions, the proudest metaphysical
speculations, so soon as they involve human
morality, human evolution and the human
future, have always been obliged to reduce
themselves to human proportions, to become
anthropomorphous. This is an invincible
necessity, by virtue of which, despite
the horizons that tempt us on every
hand, it behoves us to limit our ideas and
our outlook.</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>Let us then limit them and once more
ask ourselves, this time remaining within
our sphere, what, after all, is this evil
which Karma punishes? If we go to the
very root of the matter, evil always arises
from a lack of intelligence, from an erroneous
and incomplete judgment, obscured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
or restricted by our egoism, which
allows us to perceive only the proximate or
immediate advantages of an action harmful
to ourselves or others, while concealing
the remote but inevitable consequences
which such an action always ends by begetting.
The whole science of ethics,
after all, is based only upon intelligence;
and what we call heart, sentiments, character
is in fact nothing but accumulated and
crystallized intelligence, inherited or acquired,
which has become more or less unconscious
and is transformed into habits
or instincts. The evil which we do we do
only because of a mistaken egoism, which
sees the limits of its being too near at hand.
As soon as intelligence raises the point of
view of this egoism, the limits extend,
widen and end by disappearing. The terrible
and insatiable ego loses its centre of
attraction and avidity and knows itself,
finds itself and loves itself in all things.
Let us not believe blindly in the intelligence
of the wicked who succeed, or in the happiness
of the criminal. We ought rather to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
see the converse, that is to say, the often
hideous reality of the success; moreover,
this intelligence, in the shape of skill, cunning
or disloyalty, is a specialized intelligence,
confined within a narrow circuit and,
like a constricted jet of water, very effective
when directed at a single point; but it
is not a true and general, spacious and generous
intelligence. Wherever the latter
reveals itself, we necessarily find honesty,
justice, forbearance, love and kindness, because
there is a lofty and full horizon and
because there is an instinctive or conscious
knowledge of human proportions, of the
eternity of existence and the brevity of life,
of man&#8217;s position in the universe, of the
mysteries that compass him about and the
secret bonds that unite him to all things
that we see as well as to all things that we
do not see upon earth and in the heavens.</p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>Is Karma, then, supposed to punish lack
of intelligence? And, in the first place,
why not? It is the only real evil upon this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
earth; and, if all men were superlatively
intelligent, none would be unhappy. But
where would the justice of it be? We possess
the intelligence which nature has bestowed
upon us; it is she, not we, that
should be held responsible. Let us understand
one another. Karma does not inflict
punishment, properly speaking; it simply
places us, after our successive existences
and slumbers, on the plane on which
our intelligence left us, surrounded by our
actions and our thoughts. It keeps a
check and a record. It takes us such as
we have made ourselves and gives us the
opportunity to make ourselves anew, to
acquire what we lack and to raise ourselves
to the level of the highest. We are bound
to raise ourselves, but the slowness or rapidity
of our ascent depends only upon
ourselves. When all is said, the apparent
injustice which grants more intelligence to
some than to others is but a question of
date, a law of growth, of evolution, which
is the fundamental law of all the lives that
we know, from the infusoria to the stars.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
We could at most complain of coming later
than the rest; but the rest, in their turn,
might with more reason complain of being
called too soon, of being unable to profit
at once by all that has been acquired since
their birth. To avoid recrimination,
therefore, we should all have been on the
same plane from the outset; we should all
have been born at the same time. But
then the world would have been complete,
perfect, immutable, immobile, from the
first moment of its existence and ours.
This would perhaps have been preferable;
but it is not so and it is, no doubt, impossible
that it should be so; in any case,
no system of metaphysics, no religion, not
even the first, the greatest, the loftiest, the
mother of all the rest, ever thought of rejecting
the indisputable and indubitable
law of endless movement, of the eternal
Becoming; and it must be admitted that
everything appears to justify it. It is probable
that there would be nothing if it
were otherwise and that there can only be
something on condition that it becomes better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
or worse, that it rises or falls, that it
constitutes itself in order to deconstitute
and reconstitute itself and that movement
is more essential than being or substance.
It is so because it is so. There is nothing
to be done, nothing to be said; we can but
state the fact. We are in a world in which
matter would perish and disappear sooner
than movement, or rather in which matter,
time, space, duration, existence and movement
are but one and the same thing.</p>


<h3>12</h3>

<p>But we also live in a world in which our
reason encounters only the impossible, the
insoluble and the incomprehensible. The
supreme interpretations do no more than
shift the riddle, to permit us to obtain
glimpses from a higher standpoint of the
boundless immensity in which we are striving.
Therefore, apart from the puerile
explanations which, after successive
changes of form, all the religions have
drawn from the original religion, three hypotheses
and no more offer themselves for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
our choice: on the one hand, nothingness,
inertia and absolute death, which are inconceivable;
on the other hand, chance and
its eternal renewals, which are without
change, hope, object or end, or which, if
they led to anything, would lead either to
an inconceivable annihilation or to the
third hypothesis, according to which the
best becomes infinite, even to total absorption
in the imperfectible, the immutable,
the immovable, which, as I have said elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
must have occurred already in the
eternity that precedes us, since there is no
reason why that which could not take place
in this eternity should take place in the
eternity to come, which is no more infinite,
is no more extensive and offers no more
chances than the past eternity and which is
not of a different nature.</p>

<p>The mother religion itself, the only one
which is still acceptable, which takes account
of everything and which has foreseen
everything, does not escape this last dilemma
by extending to thousands of millions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
of years the duration of a year of
Brahma, that is to say, the period of evolution,
of expiration, of externalization
and activity, and to an equal number of
thousands of millions of years the duration
of a night of this god, that is to say, the
period of involution, of inspiration, of internalization,
of slumber or inertia, during
which all is reabsorbed into the divinity or
the sole absolute. It does not escape it
either by next multiplying these days and
nights by a hundred years which form one
life and this life by a hundred lives which
lead to figures that defy expression, after
which another universe begins.</p>



<p>Here, too, there would be either an eternal
recommencement without hope or object,
or, if there be progression, final perfection
and immobility which ought already
to be attained. Let each draw from
all this such conclusions as he please or
can, or bow once more, in silence, before
the Unknowable.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
